2023 Financial Report

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Reporting
The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements (“financial statements”) of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (doing
business under the name “AtkinsRéalis”) (the “Company” or “AtkinsRéalis”) and all the information in this financial report are
the responsibility of management and are approved by the Board of Directors.
The financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
When alternative accounting methods exist, management has chosen those it considers most appropriate in the circumstances.
The material accounting policies used are described in Note 2 to the financial statements. Certain amounts in the financial
statements are based on estimates and judgements. Management has determined such amounts on a reasonable basis in order to
ensure that the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects. Management has prepared the financial
information presented elsewhere in the financial report and has ensured that it is consistent with that in the financial statements.
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (the “CFO”) are responsible for having
established and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. The CEO and the
CFO have supervised an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, as at
December 31, 2023, in accordance with the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and the CFO
have concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, as at December 31, 2023, was effective to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of its financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that management fulfills its responsibilities for financial reporting and is
ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving the financial statements. The Board of Directors carries out this
responsibility principally through its Audit and Risk Committee (the “Audit Committee”).
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board of Directors, and all of its members are independent directors. The Audit
Committee meets periodically with management, as well as with the internal and independent auditors, to discuss disclosure
controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting, management information systems, accounting policies,
auditing and financial reporting issues, to satisfy itself that each party is properly discharging its responsibilities, and to review
the financial statements, the Management’s Discussion and Analysis and the independent auditor’s report. The Audit Committee
reports its findings to the Board of Directors for consideration when approving the financial statements for issuance to the
shareholders. The Audit Committee also considers, for review by the Board of Directors and approval by the shareholders, the
engagement or reappointment of the independent auditor, and reviews and approves the terms of its engagement as well as the
fee, scope and timing of its services.
The financial statements have been audited, on behalf of the shareholders, by Deloitte LLP, the independent auditor, in
accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. The independent auditor has full and free access to the Audit
Committee and may meet with or without the presence of management.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Shareholders of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (doing business under the name
“AtkinsRéalis”) (the “Company” or “AtkinsRéalis”), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as at
December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income,
consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years then ended, and notes to
the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information (collectively referred to as the “financial
statements”).
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years then ended in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards (“Canadian GAAS”). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial
Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance
with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.

Key Audit Matter
A key audit matter is a matter that, in our professional judgment, was of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. This matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on
this matter.
Revenue – Lump-sum turnkey (“LSTK”) construction contracts – Refer to Notes 2H, 3 and 9 to the financial statements
Key Audit Matter Description
The Company recognizes revenue on LSTK contracts over time using an input method, based on costs incurred to date relative
to total anticipated costs at completion. The accounting for LSTK contracts that are not complete at the reporting date
(“uncompleted contracts”) involves judgment, particularly as it relates to determining the transaction price and estimating total
anticipated costs at completion. The transaction price corresponds to the amount of consideration to which the Company expects
to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. This amount could include an amount of
variable consideration from estimated volume of work, claims and unpriced change orders, and incentives or penalties, to the
extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated
with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Total anticipated costs at completion include both incurred costs to
date as well as anticipated costs to complete which could include contingencies and reserves. These costs are impacted by a
variety of factors such as potential variances in scheduling and cost of materials along with the availability and cost of qualified
labour and subcontractors, productivity, and possible claims from subcontractors. Given the duration of LSTK contracts, these
assumptions change over time, as the contract is being completed.
Given the significant judgments necessary to account for the Company’s LSTK uncompleted contracts such as the
determination of the variable consideration to be included in the transaction price and the costs to complete each contract,
auditing such estimates required extensive audit effort due to the complexity of these estimates and a high degree of auditor
attention was required when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures.
How the Key Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the variable consideration and cost to complete of LSTK uncompleted contracts included the
following, among others:
•

For a sample of LSTK uncompleted contracts we:
◦

2

Obtained and inspected the executed contracts, amendments, pending change orders or claims confirming key
terms with project management.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (CONTINUED)

•

◦

Conducted inquiries with management and project personnel to gain an understanding of the status of project
activities.

◦

Performed site visits to certain project locations, directly observing project status, and making inquiries of site
personnel regarding the status of project activities.

◦

Examined the documentation from management’s experts, including legal interpretation of relevant
contractual clauses and assessments of the contractual entitlement, and management’s assessment of the value
of the variable consideration.

◦

Based on historical experience with the same customer or other similar contracts, third-party assessments,
legal interpretations, and probabilistic methodologies, evaluated that management’s assessment that the
variable consideration is limited to the amount that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue
recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently
resolved.

◦

Evaluated cost to complete by testing key components of the cost to complete estimates.

Performed certain retrospective review procedures to assess management’s historical ability to accurately estimate the
transaction price (including variable consideration) and cost to complete as well as to identify any significant or
unusual changes in project revenue and cost forecasts during the period in LSTK contracts.

Other Information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises:
•

Management’s Discussion and Analysis;

•

The information, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, in the Financial Report and the
Annual Integrated Report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
We obtained Management’s Discussion and Analysis prior to the date of this auditor’s report. If, based on the work we have
performed on this other information we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required
to report that fact in this auditor’s report. We have nothing to report in this regard.
The Financial Report and Annual Integrated Report are expected to be made available to us after the date of the auditor’s
report. If, based on the work we will perform on this other information, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact to those charged with governance.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for
such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian GAAS will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements.

3

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (CONTINUED)
As part of an audit in accordance with Canadian GAAS, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
control.

•

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

•

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by management.

•

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

•

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether
the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

•

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within
the Company to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance
in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in
our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is François Sauvageau.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (doing business under the name “AtkinsRéalis”) is incorporated under the Canada Business
Corporations Act and has its registered office at 455 René-Lévesque Boulevard West, Montreal, Québec, H2Z 1Z3, Canada.
SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. is a public company whose common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada.
Reference to the “Company”, “AtkinsRéalis” or to “SNC-Lavalin” means, as the context may require, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.
and all or some of its subsidiaries or joint arrangements or associates, or SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. or one or more of its
subsidiaries or joint arrangements or associates.
Created by the integration of long-standing organizations dating back to 1911, AtkinsRéalis is a world-leading professional
services and project management company that connects people, data and technology to transform the world’s infrastructure and
energy systems.
The Company reports its revenues as follows:
•

Professional Services & Project Management (“PS&PM”) includes contracts generating revenues related mainly to
consulting, advisory and environmental services, intelligent networks and cybersecurity, design and engineering,
procurement, project and construction management, operations and maintenance, and decommissioning. It also includes
revenues from lump-sum turnkey (“LSTK”) construction contracts, on which the Company ceased bidding in July 2019,
except for certain repetitive engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) offerings that are lower-risk,
standardized solutions.

•

Capital investments include AtkinsRéalis’ investments in infrastructure concessions for public services such as bridges,
highways, mass transit systems, power facilities, energy infrastructure, water treatment plants and social infrastructure
(e.g. hospitals).

In these consolidated financial statements (“financial statements”), activities related to PS&PM are collectively referred to as
“from PS&PM” to distinguish them from activities related to the Company’s Capital investments.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A)

BASIS OF PREPARATION

The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) issued and effective for the year ended December 31, 2023, and are presented in Canadian dollars. All values in the
tables included in these notes are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars, except where otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies set out below were consistently applied to all periods presented.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant, are disclosed in
Note 3.
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, with the exception, when applicable, of:
i) certain financial instruments, derivative financial instruments and liabilities for share unit plans, which are measured at fair
value; ii) defined benefit assets (liabilities), which are measured as the net total of the fair value of plan assets minus the present
value of the defined benefit obligation; iii) investments measured at fair value held by SNC-Lavalin Infrastructure Partners LP,
which is an investment entity accounted for by the equity method and for which the Company elected to retain the fair value
measurement applied by that investment entity; and iv) certain assets held for sale, which are measured at fair value less cost to
sell. Historical cost generally represents the fair value of consideration given in exchange for assets upon initial recognition.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another
valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of
the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the
measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial statements is determined on such a
basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, and
measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realizable value in IAS 2, Inventories,
or value in use in IAS 36, Impairment of Assets.
The Company’s financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company on February 29, 2024.

NEW AMENDMENTS ADOPTED IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023

The following amendments to existing standards were adopted by the Company on January 1, 2023:
•

Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, (“IAS 1”) change the requirements in IAS 1 with regard to
disclosure of accounting policies. Applying the amendments, an entity discloses its material accounting policies instead
of its significant accounting policies. Further amendments to IAS 1 are made to explain how an entity can identify a
material accounting policy.

•

Amendments to IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, (“IAS 8”) replace the
definition of a change in accounting estimates with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition,
accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”.

•

Amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes, (“IAS 12”) specify how entities should account for deferred income taxes on
transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. In specified circumstances, entities are exempt from
recognizing deferred income taxes when they recognize assets or liabilities for the first time. The amendments clarify that
the exemption does not apply to transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations and that entities are
required to recognize deferred income taxes on such transactions.

The following amendments issued in the second quarter of 2023 were adopted by the Company in the same period:
•

Amendments to IAS 12 introduce: i) a temporary exception to the accounting for deferred income taxes arising from
jurisdictions implementing the global minimum tax rules; and ii) targeted disclosure requirements to help investors better
understand an entity’s exposure to income taxes arising from the global minimum tax rules, particularly before legislation
implementing the rules is in effect.

The adoption by the Company of the amendments listed above did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial
statements. The amendments to IAS 1 did not result in any changes to the Company’s accounting policies, but only impacted the
information disclosed on such policies in the financial statements, notably in Note 2 “Summary of material accounting policies”,
as applicable. The amendments to IAS 12 adopted in the second quarter of 2023 resulted in additional information disclosed
related to the global minimum tax rules in Note 28 “Income taxes”.
C)

CHANGE IN PRESENTATION – STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

Effective October 1, 2023, the Company modified the presentation of its statement of financial position by combining the
following line items: i) “Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt – Recourse” and “Short-term debt and current
portion of long-term debt – Non-recourse” into the line item “Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt” (see
Notes 19 and 27); ii) “Long-term debt – Recourse”, “Long-term debt – Limited recourse” and “Long-term debt – Non-recourse”
into the line item “Long-term debt” (see Notes 19 and 27); and iii) “Inventories” and “Other current non-financial assets” into
the line item “Other current non-financial assets” (see Note 11).
These changes were made to simplify the presentation of the Company’s statement of financial position with information related
to these line items now being presented in the notes to financial statements.
This change in presentation was made in accordance with IAS 8, resulting in the restatement of prior year figures.
Also, effective October 1, 2023, the Company renamed the line item previously titled “Contract liabilities” to “Deferred revenues”

in its statement of financial position.
D)

PROGRESS IN THE TRANSITION TO ALTERNATIVE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES

On May 16, 2022, Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Limited, the administrator of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate
(“CDOR”), following the authorization granted by the Ontario Securities Commission and the Autorité des marchés financiers
(Québec), announced that the calculation and publication of all tenors of CDOR will permanently cease immediately following
a final publication on June 28, 2024. As at December 31, 2023, the Company determined that, based on analysis made until that
date, its material contracts making reference to CDOR and having outstanding balances as at December 31, 2023 were not
expected to be significantly impacted by the change, either because of their expected maturity date, because they already
incorporate fallback provisions to establish an alternate reference rate to CDOR or because they are expected to be novated to a
new interest benchmark rate prior to the final publication date of CDOR. The Company will continue monitoring the situation
on its existing and upcoming contracts until the last publication of the CDOR rate expected in June 2024.

E)

AMENDMENTS ISSUED TO BE ADOPTED AT A LATER DATE

The following amendments to existing standards have been issued and are applicable to the Company for its annual periods
beginning on January 1, 2024 and thereafter, with an earlier application permitted:
• Amendments to IFRS 16, Leases, require a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a leaseback
in a way that it does not recognize any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains. The new
requirements do not prevent a seller-lessee from recognizing in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the partial or full
termination of a lease.
• Amendments to IAS 1 clarify how to classify debt and other liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments help to
determine whether, in the statement of financial position, debt and other liabilities with an uncertain settlement date
should be classified as current (due or potentially due to be settled within one year) or non-current. The amendments also
clarify the classification requirements for debt an entity might settle by converting it into equity.
• Amendments to IAS 1 specify that covenants to be complied with after the reporting date do not affect the classification
of debt as current or non-current at the reporting date. Instead, the amendments require an entity to disclose information
about these covenants in the notes to financial statements.
• Amendments to IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows, and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, introduce disclosure
requirements to enhance the transparency of supplier finance arrangements and their effects on an entity’s liabilities, cash
flows and exposure to liquidity risk.
The following amendments to an existing standard have been issued and are applicable to the Company for its annual periods
beginning on January 1, 2025 and thereafter, with an earlier application permitted:
• Amendments to IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, require an entity to apply a consistent
approach in assessing whether a currency can be exchanged into another currency and, when it cannot, in determining the
exchange rate to use and the disclosures to provide.
The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of adopting these amendments on its financial statements.
F)

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

In accordance with IFRS, AtkinsRéalis’ interests in other entities subject to control, joint control or significant influence are
accounted for as follows:
TYPE OF INTEREST

TYPE OF INFLUENCE

ACCOUNTING METHOD

Subsidiary

Control

Consolidation method

Joint venture

Joint control

Equity method

Joint operation

Joint control

AtkinsRéalis’ share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses

Associate

Significant influence

Equity method

Investment

Non-significant influence

Measured at fair value; dividend income is recognized in the
income statement.

A subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by AtkinsRéalis results in non-controlling interests that are presented separately on the
consolidated statement of financial position, while the portions of net income and other comprehensive income attributable to
such non-controlling interests are also shown separately on the consolidated income statement and on the consolidated statement
of comprehensive income, respectively.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates to bring
their accounting policies in line with those used by the Company.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
If the Company loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill and intangible assets
related to business combinations), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity and remeasures any
investment retained at fair value, while any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated income statement.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Business acquisitions
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at
the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of acquisition) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments
issued by the Company, if any, in exchange for control of the acquiree. Provisional fair values allocated at a reporting date are
finalized within twelve months of the acquisition date.
At the date of acquisition, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are measured, with limited exceptions, at
fair value.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which these costs are incurred and the services are received.
The results of businesses acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is
obtained.
G)

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Functional and presentation currency
The individual financial statements of each entity within the Company are prepared in its functional currency, being the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial
statements, the results and financial position of each entity within the Company are expressed in Canadian dollars, which is the
presentation currency of the Company for its consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currency transactions and balances
For the purpose of preparing financial statements, Canadian and foreign operations apply the following procedure on
transactions and balances in currencies other than their functional currency: 1) monetary items are translated in their functional
currency using the exchange rate in effect at the period end rate; 2) non-monetary items are translated in their functional
currency using the historical exchange rate if they are measured at cost, or using the exchange rate at the measurement date if
they are measured at fair value; and 3) revenues and expenses are translated in their functional currency using the appropriate
average exchange rate of the period. Any resulting gains or losses are recognized in net income and, if hedge accounting is
applied, offsetting losses or gains from the hedging items are also recognized in net income.
Translation of financial statements of foreign operations
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements in Canadian dollars, the assets and liabilities of the Company’s
foreign operations that have a functional currency other than Canadian dollars are expressed in Canadian dollars using exchange
rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period, while revenues and expenses are translated at the appropriate average
exchange rate for the period. Exchange differences arising on consolidation, if any, are recognized initially in other
comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to net income on disposal or partial disposal of foreign operations.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the
foreign operation and translated at the period end rate.
H)

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized, for each performance obligation, either over a period of time or at a point
in time, depending on which method reflects the transfer of control of the goods or services underlying the particular
performance obligation to the customer.
In most cases, for performance obligations satisfied over time, the Company recognizes revenue over time using an input
method, based on costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion, to measure progress toward satisfying
such performance obligations. Under this method, costs that do not contribute to the performance of the Company in
transferring control of goods or services to the customer are excluded from the measurement of progress toward satisfying the
performance obligation. For certain contracts, notably certain cost-plus contracts or unit-rate contracts, the Company recognizes
revenue based on its right to consideration when such amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity’s
performance completed to date. In certain other situations, the Company might recognize revenue at a point in time, when the
criteria to recognize revenue over time are not met. In any event, when the total anticipated costs exceed the total anticipated
revenues on a contract, such loss is recognized in its entirety in the period it becomes known and a provision for forecasted
losses on contracts is recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position.

14

NOTES TO 2023 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The amount of revenue recognized by the Company is based on the transaction price allocated to each performance obligation.
Such transaction price corresponds to the amount of consideration which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in
exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The
transaction price includes, among other things and when applicable, an estimate of variable consideration only to the extent that
it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the
uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Variable consideration is usually derived from
incentives, performance bonuses, and penalties, and could include claims and unpriced change orders. When a contract includes
a significant financing component, the value of such component is excluded from the transaction price and is recognized
separately as finance income or expense, as applicable.
AtkinsRéalis may enter into contractual arrangements with a client to deliver services on one project with respect to more than
one performance obligation. When entering into such arrangements, the Company allocates the transaction price by reference to
the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. Accordingly, when such arrangements exist on the same project,
the value of each performance obligation is based on its stand-alone selling price and recognized according to the respective
revenue recognition methods described above.
The Company accounts for a contract modification, which consists of a change in the scope or price (or both) of a contract, as a
separate contract when the remaining goods or services to be delivered after the modification are distinct from those delivered
prior to the modification and the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that reflects the stand-alone
selling price of the additional promised goods or services. When the contract modification is not accounted for as a separate
contract, the Company recognizes an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis at the date of contract modification.
The Company recognizes assurance-type warranty costs as a provision in accordance with IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent
Liabilities and Contingent Assets, based on the advancement of the projects, and the provision recognized is then either used
when costs are incurred or reversed if it is no longer needed.
In all cases, the value of construction activities, material and equipment purchased by AtkinsRéalis, when acting as purchasing
agent for a client, is not recorded as revenue.
The Company may apply its revenue recognition policy to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar
characteristics if the effect on its financial statements of applying such policy to the portfolio is not reasonably expected to differ
materially from applying its policy to the individual contracts or performance obligations within that portfolio.
The Company presents its contract balances, on a contract-by-contract basis, in a net contract asset or deferred revenues
position, separately from its trade receivables. Contract assets and trade receivables are both rights to receive consideration in
exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to a customer, however the classification depends on whether
such right is only conditional on the passage of time (trade receivables) or if it is also conditional on something else (contract
assets), such as the satisfaction of further performance obligations under the contract. Deferred revenues represent the
cumulative amount received and contractually receivable by the Company that exceeds the right to consideration resulting from
the Company’s performance under a given contract.
Revenues from Capital investments include the following:

AtkinsRéalis’ share of net results of the Capital investments or dividends from its Capital investments for which the

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Unless specifically covered by another accounting policy, the measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities is based
on their classification, which is one of the following for AtkinsRéalis:
CATEGORY –
SUBSEQUENTLY
MEASURED AT

APPLICABLE TO

INITIAL MEASUREMENT

SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT

RECOGNITION OF INCOME/EXPENSE AND GAINS/LOSSES
ON REMEASUREMENT, IF ANY

Fair value
through profit
or loss
(“FVTPL”)

Financial assets
and financial
liabilities

Fair value

Fair value derived from published bid
price quotations for listed securities.
Where there is no active market, fair
value is determined using valuation
techniques.

All recognized in net income

Fair value
through other
comprehensive
income
(“FVTOCI”)

Financial assets

Fair value including
transaction costs

Fair value derived from published bid
price quotations for listed securities.
Where there is no active market, fair
value is determined using valuation
techniques.

Investment income, which includes interest,
dividends and distributions, is recognized in net
income. For equity instruments, gains (losses)
from revaluation are recognized in other
comprehensive income with no reclassification
to net income on disposal of such assets.

Amortized cost

Financial assets
and financial
liabilities

Fair value including
transaction costs

Amortized cost using the effective
interest method

All recognized in net income

Impairment of assets subsequently measured at amortized cost
For “Trade receivables”, “Contract assets” and “Finance lease receivables”, the amount of the loss allowance recognized is the
amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses that result from all possible events of default over the expected life of a financial
instrument.
For “Non-current portion of receivables under service concession arrangements”, if the credit risk has not increased significantly
since initial recognition, the amount of the loss allowance recognized is the amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses
that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.
Write-off
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is reduced when there are no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial
asset in its entirety or a portion thereof.
HEDGING (APPLYING IAS 39)

In the normal course of its business, AtkinsRéalis enters into derivative financial instruments, mainly: i) forward exchange
contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on projects; and ii) interest-rate swaps to
hedge the variability of interest rates relating to financing arrangements. AtkinsRéalis may also enter into other derivative
financial instruments to hedge its exposure to market risk. When applying hedge accounting, AtkinsRéalis formally documents
its accounting choice, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective
and strategy for undertaking these hedge transactions, and regularly assesses the effectiveness of these hedges.
CASH FLOW HEDGES

Derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are measured at fair value established by using valuation
techniques based on observable market data and taking into account the credit quality of the instruments. The effective portion
of the change in fair value of the derivative financial instruments is recorded in other components of equity, while the
ineffective portion, if any, of such change is recognized in net income. Gains or losses from cash flow hedges included in other
components of equity are reclassified to net income as an offset to the losses or gains recognized on the underlying hedged
items.
FAIR VALUE HEDGES

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognized in net income
immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change
in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in
net income in the same line item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Company revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or
is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the
hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated
under “Exchange differences on translating foreign operations” in “Other components of equity”. The gain or loss relating to the
ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income, and is included in the “Financial expenses” line item.
Gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in “Exchange differences
on translating foreign operations” are reclassified to net income on the disposal of the foreign operation.

SERVICE CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS UNDER IFRIC INTERPRETATION 12

IFRIC Interpretation 12, Service Concession Arrangements, (“IFRIC 12”) provides guidance on the accounting for certain
qualifying public-private partnership arrangements, whereby the grantor (i.e., usually a government):
▪

controls or regulates what services the operator (i.e. “the concessionaire”) must provide with the infrastructure, to
whom it must provide them, and at what price; and

▪

controls any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement.

Under such concession arrangements, the concessionaire accounts for the infrastructure asset by applying one of the following
accounting models depending on the allocation of the demand risk through the usage of the infrastructure between the grantor
and the concessionaire:
ACCOUNTING MODEL

DEMAND RISK

Financial asset model

The concessionaire does not bear demand risk through the usage of the infrastructure (i.e., it has an unconditional right to
receive cash irrespective of the usage of the infrastructure, e.g. availability payments).

Intangible asset model

The concessionaire bears demand risk (i.e., it has a right to charge fees for usage of the infrastructure).

Bifurcated model

The concessionaire shares demand risk with the grantor (i.e., the grantor pays the concessionaire for its services partly by a
financial asset and partly by granting a right to charge users of the infrastructure).

Revenues from service concession arrangements accounted for under IFRIC 12 are recognized as follows:
ACTIVITIES PROVIDED BY THE CONCESSIONAIRE

Construction or upgrade
(when a service concession arrangement involves
the construction or upgrade of the public service
infrastructure)

CLASSIFICATION OF REVENUES IN THE COMPANY’S
CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues relating to such activities under a service
concession arrangement are recognized based on
the Company’s accounting policy on recognizing
revenue (see Note 2H).

The Company classifies these revenues as “from
PS&PM” when AtkinsRéalis acts as an EPC
contractor. When AtkinsRéalis does not act as an
EPC contractor, revenues are recognized by the
concession as part of “Capital investments”
activities.

Operations and maintenance (“O&M”)
(these activities may include maintenance of the
infrastructure and other activities provided
directly to the grantor or the users)

The Company classifies these revenues as “from
PS&PM” when AtkinsRéalis acts as an O&M
contractor. When AtkinsRéalis does not act as an
O&M contractor, revenues are recognized by the
concession as part of “Capital investments”
activities.

Rehabilitation
(when a service concession arrangement requires
the
concessionaire
to
rehabilitate
the
infrastructure such that the infrastructure can
deliver a specified standard of service at all
times)

The Company classifies these revenues as “from
PS&PM” activities when AtkinsRéalis acts as a
rehabilitation contractor. When AtkinsRéalis
does not act as a rehabilitation contractor,
revenues are recognized by the concession as
part of “Capital investments” activities.

Financing
(when financial asset model or bifurcated model is
applied)

Finance income generated on financial assets is
recognized using the effective interest method.

The Company classifies this finance income as
“Capital investments” activities.

When the Company delivers more than one category of activity in a service concession arrangement, the consideration received
or receivable is allocated by reference to the stand-alone selling price of the activity delivered.
Financial asset model
Revenues recognized by the Company under the financial asset model are accumulated in “Receivables under service
concession arrangements”, a financial asset that is recovered through payments received from the grantor.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Intangible asset model
The Company recognizes an intangible asset arising from a service concession arrangement when it has a right to charge for
usage of the concession infrastructure. The intangible asset received as consideration for providing construction or upgrade
services in a service concession arrangement is measured at fair value upon initial recognition. Borrowing costs, if any, are
capitalized until the infrastructure is ready for its intended use as part of the carrying amount of the intangible asset.
The intangible asset is then amortized over its expected useful life, which is the concession period in a service concession
arrangement. The amortization period begins when the infrastructure is available for use.
Fees collected by the concessionaire upon the usage of the infrastructure are classified as revenues from “Capital investments”
activities.
K)

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash includes cash on hand and deposits held at call with financial institutions. Cash is designated as at FVTPL and accounted
for at fair value.
Cash equivalents include short-term liquid investments that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and which are
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash equivalents are designated as at FVTPL and accounted for at fair value.
L)

RESTRICTED CASH

Restricted cash includes cash and cash equivalents for which the use is restricted for specific purposes under certain
arrangements. Restricted cash that is not expected to become unrestricted within the next twelve months is included in “Other
non-current financial assets”. Restricted cash is designated as at FVTPL and accounted for at fair value.
M)

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded at rates set to charge operations with the cost of
depreciable assets less their residual values (if any) over their estimated useful lives.
Property and equipment are primarily:

N)

INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES

The Company’s investments in its joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method, except when the
investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held
for Sale and Discontinued Operations. Under the equity method, the investment in a joint venture or an associate is initially
recognized at cost, which includes transaction costs. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognize changes in
the Company’s share of net assets (liabilities) of the joint venture or associate since the acquisition date, until the date on which
joint control or significant influence ceases. Where the Company’s share of losses of a joint venture or an associate exceeds its
equity accounted interest in that joint venture or associate, including any other unsecured long-term receivables that, in
substance, form part of the Company’s net investment in that joint venture or associate, the Company does not recognize further
losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Upon loss of joint control over the joint venture or significant influence over the associate, the Company measures and
recognizes any retained investment at its fair value at that time. Any difference between the carrying amount of the joint venture
or associate upon loss of joint control or significant influence, respectively, and the fair value of the retained investment and
proceeds from disposal is recognized in the consolidated income statement.
The Company’s Capital investments in joint ventures and associates are included in “Capital investments accounted for by the
equity method” in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Company’s PS&PM investments in joint ventures and
associates are included in “Other non-current non-financial assets” in the consolidated statement of financial position.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognized separately from goodwill are initially recognized at their
fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated
amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains
and losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and
the carrying amount of the asset, are recognized in net income when the asset is derecognized.
P)

IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL

At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its property and equipment, right-of-use
assets, Capital and PS&PM investments accounted for by the equity method, and its intangible assets other than goodwill to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Where it is not possible to
estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit (“CGU”) to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate
assets are also allocated to an individual CGU, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of CGU for which a
reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
Recoverable amount is the higher of: i) fair value less costs to sell; and ii) value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of
the time value of money and risks. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized
immediately in net income.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the revised estimate
of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or CGU) in prior periods. A reversal of an impairment loss is
recognized immediately in net income.
Q)

GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value assigned to assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is separately disclosed and goodwill on acquisitions of associates
and joint ventures is included within investments accounted for by the equity method. For the purpose of impairment testing,
goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s CGU or group of CGU expected to benefit from the synergies of the
combination. A CGU or group of CGU to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more
frequently when there is an indication that the CGU or group of CGU may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU
or group of CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the CGU or group of CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU or group of CGU pro rata on the basis
of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU or group of CGU. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed
in a subsequent period.
The Company has designated October 31 as the date for its annual impairment test.
R)

DIRECT COSTS OF ACTIVITIES

Direct costs of activities include costs related to the provision of goods and services for which the Company recognizes revenue,
as well as all costs incurred for activities that are part of a reportable segment or allocated to such segment, except for costs that
are presented elsewhere in the income statement.

CORPORATE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses are recognized in net income upon utilization of the service or as
incurred and include costs that are not related to a contract with a customer or incurred for activities that are part of a reportable
segment, or allocated to such segment, and that are not presented elsewhere in the income statement. Corporate selling, general
and administrative expenses also include changes in fair value of financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
T)

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except if the costs are related to the development and setup of new
products, processes and systems and satisfy generally accepted conditions for capitalization, including reasonable assurance that
they will be recovered. All capitalized development costs are amortized when commercial production begins, using the straightline method over a period not exceeding ten years.
U)

TAXES

Current income tax
Income taxes recognized in net income comprise the sum of deferred income tax and current income tax not recognized in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise amounts receivable from or payable to tax authorities relating to the current
or prior reporting periods, which are uncollected or unpaid at the reporting date. Current tax is payable on taxable income,
which differs from net income in the financial statements. Calculation of current tax is based on tax rates and tax laws that have
been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred income tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries,
joint arrangements and associates is not provided for if the reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the
Company and it is probable that the reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to their
respective period of realization, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the
extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which they can be utilized. For management’s
assessment of the probability of future taxable income to utilize against deferred income tax assets, see Note 3.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the Company has a right and intention to offset current tax assets
and liabilities from the same taxation authority.
Sales tax
Revenues, expenses, and assets excluding trade receivables, are recognized net of the amount of sales tax receivable from or
payable to a taxation authority, except for expenses and assets (i) when the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services
is not receivable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales tax is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the
asset or as part of the expense item, respectively; and (ii) when receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax
included.
The net amount of sales tax receivable from or payable to a taxation authority is included in “Other current non-financial assets”
or “Other current non-financial liabilities”, respectively, in the consolidated statement of financial position.
V)

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, OTHER LONG-TERM BENEFITS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

The liability (included in “Provisions”) or asset (included in “Other non-current non-financial assets”) recognized in the
consolidated statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans results, on an individual plan basis, from
the shortfall or excess of the fair value of plan assets over the net present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the
reporting period. Defined benefit pension plans, other long-term benefits and other post-employment benefits obligations are
determined using the projected unit credit method, which sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of
benefit entitlement to the eligible employees and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation. In valuing the
defined benefit cost, assumptions are based on management’s best estimates, except for the discount rate where the Company
uses market yields at the measurement date based on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows that match the timing and
amount of expected benefit payments.

Remeasurement, comprising: i) actuarial gains and losses; ii) the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable); and
iii) the return on plans’ assets (excluding interest income), is credited or charged to equity in other comprehensive income in the
period in which it arises. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is not reclassified to net income in
subsequent periods. The cumulative amount of remeasurement is included in retained earnings.
Defined benefit costs comprise: i) service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on
curtailments and settlements); ii) net interest expense or income; and iii) remeasurement. Service cost and net interest income or
expense are recognized in net income while the remeasurement is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period. Net
interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
W)

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic and diluted earnings per share are determined by dividing consolidated net income attributable to AtkinsRéalis
shareholders for the period by the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding, respectively.
The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is calculated as if all dilutive options had been exercised at the later
of the beginning of the reporting period or date of grant with deemed proceeds from the exercise of such dilutive options used to
repurchase common shares at the average market price for the period.
X)

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

Stock options
Stock options granted to employees are measured at their fair value at the grant date. The estimated fair value of the stock
options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the stock options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the vesting
period or the term over which an employee becomes eligible to retire, based on the Company’s estimate of stock options that
will eventually vest. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of stock options
expected to vest and the impact of such revision, if any, is recognized in net income.
Share units
The Company’s 2019 Performance Share Unit plan (“2019 PSU plan”), 2019 Restricted Share Unit plan (“2019 RSU plan”),
2009 Deferred Share Unit plan (“2009 DSU plan”), and Deferred Share Unit plan (“DSU plan”) are collectively referred as
“share unit plans”. For share units granted to employees and members of the Company’s Board of Directors under the share unit
plans, a liability is recognized and measured at the fair value of the liability, which is based on the Company’s share price. At
the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is
remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognized in net income for the period. The fair value of the grants of share units is
expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of share
units that will eventually vest. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of share units
expected to vest and the impact of such revision, if any, is recognized in net income.
Y)

PROVISIONS

A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount that is recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is
probable that the Company will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation.
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end
of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is
measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash
flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a
receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable
can be measured reliably.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Restructuring
A restructuring provision is recognized when the Company has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has
raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or
announcing its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct
expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and
not associated with the ongoing activities of the Company.
Onerous contracts
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognized and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is
considered to exist when the Company has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the
contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract.
Z)

SHARE CAPITAL

The Company’s common shares are classified as equity instruments. Common shares issued by the Company are recognized at
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs and income taxes, if any.
Repurchase of the Company’s own common shares is recognized and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognized
in net income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own common shares.
AA)

LEASING

Accounting for leases as a lessee
The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is
initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or
before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the
underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The rightof-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of
the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term, and represents a period of up to 30 years for office real estate
leases and a period ranging from 1 to 8 years for other leased assets. In addition, the right-of-use asset is reduced by impairment
losses resulting from impairment tests conducted in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, if any, and adjusted for
certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date,
discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental
borrowing rate. Lease payments used for the calculations comprise mainly fixed payments, including in-substance fixed
payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is
reasonably certain to exercise that option; and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the
lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method and is remeasured to reflect changes in the lease payments, such as upon a lease modification that is
not accounted for as a separate lease.
A lease modification is considered a separate lease if the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use
one or more underlying assets and the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone
price for the increase in scope and any appropriate adjustments to that stand-alone price to reflect the circumstances of the
particular contract. Any other modification is not accounted for as a separate lease.
For a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, the Company accounts for the modification, at its effective
date, as follows:
a.

22

for a lease modification resulting in a decrease in the scope of the lease, such as a reduction in the term of a lease or in
the space being leased, the lease liability is remeasured to reflect the revised lease payments and the carrying amount of
the right-of-use asset is reduced to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease. If the carrying amount of the rightof-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, a lessee shall
recognize any remaining amount of the remeasurement in profit or loss. Furthermore, the difference between the
reduction in the lease liability and the reduction in the corresponding right-of-use asset’s carrying value is recognized
in profit or loss.

NOTES TO 2023 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
b.

for all other lease modifications, the lease liability is remeasured to reflect the revised lease payments, with a
corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset.

The remeasurement of a lease liability upon a lease modification, or upon any change to the lease payments resulting from a
change in the lease term or in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, is based on a revised discount rate
reflecting the remainder of the lease term. The remeasurement of a lease liability to reflect revised lease payments due to a
change in the amounts expected to be payable to the lessor under a residual value guarantee or to a change in an index or a rate
used to determine those payments, other than a change in floating interest rates, is based on an unchanged discount rate.
Accounting for leases as a lessor
When acting as a lessor, the Company determines at lease commencement whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating
lease. To classify each lease, the Company makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers to the lessee substantially
all of the risks and rewards of ownership incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a
finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease.
As part of this assessment, the Company considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the
economic life of the asset. When the Company subleases one of its leases and concludes that it is a finance lease, it derecognizes
the right-of-use asset relating to the head lease being sublet, recognizes a receivable equal to the net investment in the sublease
and retains the previously recognized lease liability in its capacity as lessee. The Company then recognizes interest expense on
its lease liability and interest income on the receivable in its capacity as finance lessor.
Accounting for sale and lease back transactions
In a sale and lease back transaction, the transfer of an asset is recognized as a sale when the customer has obtained control of
such asset based on the Company’s revenue recognition policy, otherwise the Company continues to recognize the transferred
asset on its statement of financial position and recognizes a financial liability equal to the proceeds transferred. When the
transfer of an asset satisfies the Company’s revenue recognition policy to be accounted for as a sale, a partial recognition of the
gain on disposal is recognized immediately after the sale, based on the proportion of the asset not retained by the Company
through the lease. The proportion of the asset retained by the Company through the lease is recognized as a right-of-use asset
and the lease liability is measured as the present value of future lease payments.
AB)

GOVERNMENT GRANTS

AtkinsRéalis recognizes grants from the government where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and
AtkinsRéalis will comply with all attached conditions.
Government grants are recognized in the income statement on a systematic basis over the periods in which AtkinsRéalis
recognizes as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Specifically, government grants whose
primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current assets (including property
and equipment) are recognized by deducting the grants from the carrying amount of the related assets in the statement of
financial position and transferred to the income statement on a systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of the related
assets.
Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving
immediate financial support to the Company with no future related costs are recognized in the income statement in the period in
which they become receivable.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION
UNCERTAINTY

In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, management is required to make
judgements, estimates, and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities recognized that are not readily
apparent from other sources. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that
are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

JUDGEMENTS

AND

KEY

SOURCES

OF

ESTIMATION

The following are the critical accounting judgements and key estimates concerning the future, and other key sources of
estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Revenue recognition
The identification of revenue-generating contracts with customers, the identification of performance obligations, the
determination of the transaction price and its allocation between identified performance obligations, the use of the appropriate
revenue recognition method (over time or at a point in time) for each performance obligation and the measure of progress for
each performance obligation satisfied over time are the main aspects of the revenue recognition process, all of which require the
exercise of judgement and the use of assumptions.
The transaction price corresponds to the amount of consideration which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in
exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. Such amount may require the Company to estimate an
amount of variable consideration, notably from estimated volume of work, claims and unpriced change orders, incentives or
penalties, among others. Furthermore, the Company needs to constrain the transaction price by including only the amount for
which it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the
uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The amount of variable consideration to be
included in the transaction price of a given contract is determined by using various estimates and assumptions, which could be
based on historical experience with the same customer or other similar contracts, third-party assessments, legal interpretation of
relevant contractual clauses, and probabilistic methodologies, among others. Due to the uncertain nature of the estimations, the
amount of variable consideration may vary significantly over time. Such estimated amount of variable consideration then needs
to be updated at the end of each reporting period.
The determination of anticipated costs for completing a contract is based on estimates that can be affected by a variety of factors
such as potential variances in scheduling and cost of materials along with the availability and cost of qualified labour and
subcontractors, productivity, and possible claims from subcontractors.
Service concession arrangements
The accounting for certain Capital investment activities requires the application of judgement in determining if they fall within
the scope of IFRIC 12. Additional judgements need to be exercised when determining, among other things, the accounting
model to be applied under IFRIC 12, the allocation of the consideration receivable between revenue-generating activities, the
classification of costs incurred on such activities, the accounting treatment of rehabilitation costs and associated estimates, as
well as the effective interest rate to be applied to the financial asset. As the accounting for Capital investments under IFRIC 12
requires the use of estimates over the term of the arrangement, any changes to these long-term estimates could result in a
significant variation in the accounting for the Capital investments.
Basis of consolidation
Under certain circumstances, the determination of the Company’s level of power over an investee requires the exercise of
judgement. As such, the classification of the entity as a subsidiary, a joint arrangement, an associate or an investment might
require the application of judgement through the analysis of various indicators, such as the percentage of ownership interest held
in the entity, the representation on the entity’s board of directors, and various other factors.
Values used in impairment tests
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of the CGU or group of CGU. Such
recoverable amount corresponds, for the purpose of impairment assessment, to the higher of the value in use or the fair value
less costs of disposal of the CGU or group of CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires management to estimate future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU or group of
CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The key assumptions required for the value in use
estimation are the growth rate of future cash flows and the discount rate.
When using the value in use approach, cash flows for each CGU or group of CGU are derived from the budget for the upcoming
year, which is approved on an annual basis by members of the Company’s Board of Directors, and a long-term forecast prepared
by management, which covers an additional period of up to 4 years. Cash flows beyond the long-term forecast are extrapolated
using a growth rate estimated by management. The discount rate is derived from the Company’s post-tax weighted average cost
of capital and is adjusted, where applicable, to take into account any specific risks.

When the fair value less costs of disposal approach is used, the fair value is derived from a market multiple approach. Under this

of the CGU or group of CGU, the multiples being used and the costs of disposal.
Future results for each CGU or group of CGU are derived from the budget for the upcoming year. Transaction multiples are
derived from observable market value of comparable publicly traded companies or fair value observed from recent acquisitions
or disposals of businesses that are comparable to the CGU or group of CGU. Costs of disposal, which usually corresponds to a
percentage of the fair value of the CGU or group of CGU, are estimated based on historical transactions of the Company or on
input from recent transactions.
For both the value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal approaches, the values assigned to key assumptions reflect past
experience and external sources of information that are deemed accurate and reliable. The value in use and the fair value are
categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy described under IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement, as one or more key
assumption used is based on unobservable data requiring the use of judgement.
When there is any indication that any tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill have suffered an impairment loss, the
determination of the recoverable amount of such tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill requires management to
estimate cash flows expected to arise from these assets and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value in a
manner described above for goodwill.
The identification of events that could have an impact on the estimated cash flows of the assets and the determination of these
estimated cash flows require the exercise of judgement, which might result in significant variances in the carrying amount of
these assets if found to be impaired.
The main assumptions used for the goodwill impairment testing are disclosed in Note 13.
Measurement of retirement benefit obligations, other long-term benefits and other post-employment benefit obligations
AtkinsRéalis’ obligations and expenses relating to defined benefit pension plans, other long-term benefits and other postemployment benefits are determined using actuarial valuations and are dependent on assumptions such as the rate of
compensation increase, as determined by management. While management believes these assumptions represent its best
estimate, differences in actual results or changes in assumptions could have an impact on the obligations, expenses and amounts
of actuarial gains (losses) recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Measurement of provisions shown in the consolidated statement of financial position
In measuring a provision, the Company takes risks and uncertainties into account. The uncertainties mainly relate to the timing
and amount of a provision. Also, risks and uncertainties arise from discounting a provision, where the effect of the time value of
money is significant, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Additionally, the Company takes into account future events, such as changes in the law, where there is sufficient objective
evidence that they will occur when measuring a provision. The longer duration of the period covered by certain provisions can
also increase the uncertainties of the estimates.
Contingent liabilities
As described in more detail in Note 32, the Company is subject to certain ongoing investigations, and various class actions and
other lawsuits and proceedings have been filed against the Company. The outcome of these investigations, actions, lawsuits and
proceedings, while not determinable, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s liquidity and financial results.
Measurement of share-based payment expenses
The Company offers the 2019 PSU plan to selected individuals within the organization. Depending on the attainment of
performance criteria and conditions, the number of units granted is adjusted depending on specific indicators to determine the
number of units to which all participants receiving the award will be entitled at the end of the vesting period. At each
measurement date, management is required to estimate the number of performance share units that will vest, which impacts the
amount of associated liabilities and expenses.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
UNCERTAINTY (CONTINUED)

JUDGEMENTS

AND

KEY

SOURCES

OF

ESTIMATION

Assessment of deferred income tax assets and liabilities
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts reported in the financial statements. Deferred income tax assets also reflect the benefit of unutilized tax
losses that can be carried forward to reduce income taxes in future years. This method requires the exercise of significant
judgement in determining whether or not it is probable that the Company’s deferred income tax assets would be recovered from
future taxable income and, therefore, can be recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Also, estimates are
required to determine the expected timing upon which tax assets will be realized and upon which tax liabilities will be settled,
and the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates that will apply at such time.
Measurement of financial instruments at fair value
The Company measures some of its financial instruments at fair value. The determination of such fair value is based on the most
readily available market data. When data is not readily available, management is required to estimate the fair value of the
instrument using various inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable, or that are not based on observable market data.
Assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination
Intangible assets and goodwill arising out of business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method of
accounting to these transactions. In measuring the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed and estimating
their useful lives, the Company uses significant estimates and assumptions regarding cash flow projections, economic risk, and
weighted average cost of capital.
These estimates and assumptions determine the amount allocated to intangible assets and goodwill, as well as the amortization
period for intangible assets with finite lives. If results differ from estimates, the Company may increase amortization or
recognize impairment charges.
Identification of functional currency
The functional currency for each subsidiary, joint operation, joint venture and associate is the currency of the primary economic
environment in which it operates. Determination of functional currency involves significant judgement and other entities may
make different judgements based on similar facts. AtkinsRéalis reconsiders the functional currency of its businesses if there is a
change in the underlying transactions, events or conditions which determine their primary economic environment.
The determination of functional currency affects the carrying value of non-current assets included in the statement of financial
position and, as a consequence, the amortization of those assets included in the income statement. It also impacts exchange
gains and losses included in the income statement and in equity.
Leases
Estimate of the lease term
When the Company recognizes a lease as a lessee, it assesses the lease term based on the conditions of the lease and determines
whether it is reasonably certain that it will exercise its extension or termination option, if any. It then uses the expected modified
term under such option if it is reasonably certain that it will be exercised. As such, a change in the assumption used could result
in a significant impact in the amount recognized as a right-of-use asset and lease liability, as well as in the amount of
depreciation of right-of-use asset and interest expense on lease liability.
Determining the discount rate for leases
IFRS 16 requires the Company to discount the lease payments using the rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available.
If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee is required to use its incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”). The Company
generally uses its IBR when recording leases initially, since the implicit rates are not readily available due to information not
being available from the lessor regarding the fair value of underlying assets and directs costs incurred by the lessor related to the
leased assets. The determination of the IBR requires the use of various assumptions which, if different than those being used,
could result in a significant impact in the amount recognized as a right-of-use asset and lease liability, as well as in the amount
of depreciation of right-of-use asset and interest expense on lease liability.
Determining if a contract modification increasing the scope of a lease is a separate lease or not
When a lease modification increasing the scope of a lease occurs, the Company needs to determine whether or not such
modification should be accounted for as a separate lease or not. Such determination requires the use of judgement on the standalone selling price and any appropriate adjustments to the stand-alone selling price reflecting the circumstances of the particular
contract.

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

The Company makes investments in infrastructure concessions for public services such as bridges, highways, mass transit
systems, power facilities, energy infrastructure, water treatment plants and social infrastructure (e.g. hospitals).
The main concessions and public-private partnerships contracts reported under IFRIC 12 are all accounted for under the
financial asset model.
In order to provide the reader of the financial statements with a better understanding of the financial position and results of
operations of its Capital investments, the Company presents certain distinct financial information related specifically to its
Capital investments throughout its financial statements, as well as additional information below.
A)

VARIATIONS IN OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN INVESTMENTS

I) IN 2023
CARLYLE GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE OPPORTUNITY FUND, L.P. (“CARLYLE”)

In 2023, the Company collected the remaining balance of the consideration receivable, which was previously included in “Other
current financial assets” in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial position, for the disposal of its ownership interest
in Carlyle in 2022. This consideration received of US$25.5 million (approximately CA$34.3 million) was included in “Cash
inflow on disposal of a Capital investment at fair value through other comprehensive income” in the Company’s consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023.
II) IN 2022
CARLYLE GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE OPPORTUNITY FUND, L.P.

In 2022, the Company completed the sale of its ownership interest in Carlyle, which was no longer core to the Company’s
strategy following the disposal of its Oil & Gas business in 2021, for a total consideration of US$52.1 million (approximately
CA$71.2 million), which approximated its fair value at the date of such disposal. Consideration received of US$21.5 million
(approximately CA$29.5 million), net of withholding taxes, was included in “Cash inflow on disposal of a Capital investment at
fair value through other comprehensive income” in the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2022, while the remaining balance of the consideration receivable was included in “Other current financial
assets” in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022 (see Note 10). The Company’s
investment in Carlyle was accounted for at fair value through other comprehensive income. Transaction costs incurred on the
disposal of Carlyle amounted to $0.6 million and were included in “Gain on disposals of Capital investments” in the Company’s
consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2022.
INPOWER BC GENERAL PARTNERSHIP AND ITS RELATED HOLDING COMPANIES

On February 7, 2022, the Company announced that it had completed the sale and transfer of its ownership interest in InPower
BC General Partnership and its related holding companies to SNC-Lavalin Infrastructure Partners LP (“SNCL IP Partnership”),
in which the Company has a 20% ownership interest.

Under the equity method of accounting, distributions from a joint venture reduce the carrying amount of the investment.
The equity method of accounting requires the Company to stop recognizing its share of the losses of a joint venture when
the recognition of such losses results in a negative balance for its investment, or where dividends declared by the joint
venture are in excess of the carrying amount of the investment. In these events, the carrying value of the investment is
reduced to nil, but does not become negative, unless the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made
payments on behalf of the joint venture. In these situations, the Company no longer recognizes its share of net income (loss)
of a Capital investment based on its ownership, but rather recognizes in its net income the amount of dividends declared by
a joint venture that would otherwise result in a negative carrying value of such investment.
As a result, the Company recognized in its income statement dividends from Highway 407 ETR of $64.3 million in 2023
(2022: $50.7 million) and did not recognize its share of Highway 407 ETR’s total comprehensive income of $38.3 million
(2022: $29.4 million) in the same period, as the carrying amount of its investment in Highway 407 ETR was nil at
December 31, 2023 and 2022. The negative carrying value of the Company’s investment in Highway 407 ETR, which is
not recognized on the Company’s statement of financial position, amounted to $392.6 million as at December 31, 2023
(2022: negative carrying value of $366.6 million).

The investment in Carlyle was designated to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income until its disposal in
2022 (see Note 5A) to avoid the variability of the Company’s net income in future periods.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s consolidated income included dividends of $2.8 million from Carlyle.

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)

At December 31, 2023, the commitments to invest in Capital investments were related to contributions for Eglinton Crosstown
(2022: Eglinton Crosstown) and were presented in “Other current financial liabilities” (see Note 17) since they are either
expected to be paid in the following year or are callable on demand.
In 2016, the Company signed an agreement to support a commitment of US$100 million to a fund focused on global
infrastructure investments sponsored by The Carlyle Group, subject to certain conditions. The intent of this agreement was for
the Company and The Carlyle Group to cooperate with respect to investments in, and work on, infrastructure projects.
Subsequent to the disposal of Carlyle in 2022, the related commitment to invest was nil as at December 31, 2023 and 2022.

REVENUE (CONTINUED)

Revenues by type of contract
The types of contracts presented are defined as follow:
Reimbursable and engineering services contracts: Reimbursable and engineering services contracts include all revenuegenerating contracts of the Company, except standardized EPC contracts and LSTK construction contracts described below.
Under reimbursable contracts, the Company charges the customer for the actual cost incurred plus a mark-up that could take
various forms, such as a fixed-fee per unit, a percentage of costs incurred or an incentive fee based on achieving certain targets,
performance factors or contractual milestones. Reimbursable contracts also include unit-rate contracts for which a fixed amount
per quantity is charged to the customer, and reimbursable contracts with a cap or a target price accompanied by incentives and/
or disincentives. Engineering services contracts include time and material agreements based on hourly rates and fixed-price
lump-sum contracts with limited procurement or construction risks. Reimbursable and engineering services contracts also
include all O&M contracts, most of which are fixed-price agreements subject to price-adjustment clauses such as inflationdriven indexation.
Standardized EPC contracts: Under standardized EPC contracts, the Company provides repetitive EPC offerings that are
lower-risk, standardized solutions for: i) district cooling plants; and ii) power substations executed through its Linxon
subsidiary.
LSTK construction contracts: Under LSTK construction contracts, the Company completes the work required for the project
at a lump-sum price. Before entering into such contracts, the Company estimates the total cost of the project, plus a profit
margin. The Company’s actual profit margin may vary based on its ability to achieve the project requirements at, above or
below the initial estimated costs. Although these projects are at a lump-sum price, the amount of associated revenue could
nevertheless vary based on change orders, claims or other contract modifications, negotiated or otherwise awarded, which might
take various forms. Projects in this category were all initiated as lump-sum contracts, and while in some cases have been
modified to change their lump-sum risk exposure, continue to be presented in this category.

Trade receivables are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to a customer
when such rights are only conditional on the passage of time. Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on
terms of 30 to 90 days.
Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to a customer
when such rights are not only conditional on the passage of time, but also on some other factor, such as the satisfaction of
further performance obligations under the contract. Contract assets are initially recognized for revenue earned and are usually
derecognized when they become trade receivables.
Deferred revenues represent the cumulative amounts received and contractually receivable from customers by the Company that
exceed the right to consideration resulting from the Company’s performance under a given contract.
The following table presents the amount of revenue recognized from:

$

(92,811)

$

(78,202)

As a significant portion of the Company’s revenues are recognized over time, the contractual terms which determine when
consideration becomes receivable from the customer, such as upon the achievement of certain milestones, the attainment by the
Company of such milestones earlier or later than anticipated and the ability to obtain deposits on contracts, will influence,
among other factors, the balance of trade receivables, contract assets and deferred revenues on a given contract. Due to i) the
large number of contracts entered into by the Company; ii) the variety of contractual terms of such contracts; and iii) the
different level of progress of the underlying projects, the variance of the contract assets and deferred revenues balances is not
usually attributable to a single factor, except for significant business combinations or divestitures. In 2023, the balance of
contract assets increased by an amount similar to the increase in deferred revenues.

For the purpose of annual impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a CGU or groups of CGU, which are the units expected to
benefit from the synergies of the business combinations in which the goodwill arises.
As at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s goodwill was allocated to the following CGU and groups of CGU:

In 2023, the name of this CGU was modified from “Engineering Services – United States, Asia Pacific and Mining & Metallurgy” to “Engineering
Services – United States, Asia Pacific and Minerals & Metals”.

As at December 31, 2023, approximately 49% and 29% (2022: 49% and 30%) of the Company’s goodwill balance was
allocated to the Engineering Services – United Kingdom, Europe, Middle East, India and Canada CGU and the Engineering
Services – United States, Asia Pacific and Minerals & Metals CGU, respectively. The recoverable amount of these CGU,
determined in accordance with the value in use approach, based on a terminal growth rate of 2.5% (2022: 2.5%) and a discount
rate of 11.6% (2022: 11.0%) for the Engineering Services – United Kingdom, Europe, Middle East, India and Canada CGU and
12.4% (2022: 11.5%) for the Engineering Services – United States, Asia Pacific and Minerals & Metals CGU, exceeded their
carrying amount by approximately $1,419 million (2022: approximately $650 million) and approximately $934 million (2022:
approximately $320 million), respectively, as at October 31, 2023, which is the date of the Company’s annual impairment
testing. No reasonable change in the key assumptions used for these CGU would have resulted in an impairment loss as at
October 31, 2023 and 2022.
The recoverable amount of other CGU or group of CGU was determined based on the value in use approach. Under this
approach, the following assumptions were used: cash flows beyond the long-term forecast were extrapolated using a growth rate
of 2.5% in 2023 (2022: 2.5%) and discount rates ranging from 11.2% to 12.4% have been used in 2023 (2022: from 9.6% to
10.4%). No reasonable change in the key assumptions used for these other CGU or group of CGU would have resulted in an
impairment loss as at October 31, 2023 and 2022.

SHORT-TERM DEBT AND LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)

ii. The Company’s non-revolving term loan, which is part of the 2022 Credit Agreement, is in the principal amount of
$500 million (the “Term Loan”). Borrowings under the Term Loan are being made available by way of prime rate loans or
acceptances. The Term Loan matures in May 2026 (2022: May 2025).
iii. These unsecured debentures were issued as follows: (i) $200 million in 3.235% per annum Series 4 Debentures due in
March 2023 (the “Series 4 Debentures”); (ii) $300 million in 3.80% per annum Series 6 Debentures due in August 2024
(the “Series 6 Debentures”); and (iii) $300 million in 7.00% per annum Series 7 Debentures due in June 2026 (the “Series 7
Debentures”). The Series 4 Debentures were repaid in full at their maturity in March 2023.
iv. The loan (“CDPQ Loan”) made under the loan agreement (as amended, from time to time, the “CDPQ Loan Agreement”),
dated April 20, 2017, between AtkinsRéalis Highway Holding Inc. (previously, SNC-Lavalin Highway Holdings Inc.)
(“Highway Holding”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company holding the shares of Highway 407 ETR, as
borrower, and CDPQ Revenu fixe I Inc., as lender, is a limited recourse debt comprised of two tranches: (i) tranche A
which is a non-revolving term loan in an aggregate amount of $400 million (2022: $400 million); and (ii) tranche B which
was a non-revolving term loan in an aggregate amount of $500 million. Recourse is limited to specific circumstances of
enforcement on or against the shares of Highway Holding. Each of tranche A and tranche B was available by way of a
single drawdown by Highway Holding. Borrowings under tranche A and tranche B bear interest at a base annual rate,
which is the greater of: (i) the CDOR rate; and (ii) 0.9%, plus an applicable margin. In 2018, the Company repaid
borrowings under tranche B of its CDPQ Loan in full. Tranche A of the CDPQ Loan matures in July 2026 (2022:
July 2024).
In 2022, the CDPQ Loan Agreement was amended to disapply a condition under a restrictive covenant in order to allow
dividends received by Highway Holding from Highway 407 ETR in 2022 to be distributed to the Company.
v.

The senior secured notes of a subsidiary of the Company were up to US$40.0 million (approximately CA$54.4 million)
aggregate principal amount (the “Senior Secured Notes”), of which US$38.0 million (approximately CA$51.7 million)
aggregate principal amount was issued as at December 31, 2022. The Senior Secured Notes were payable in instalments
until 2026 and bore interest at a variable rate. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes were used by
the subsidiary of the Company to finance certain long-term assets associated to a BOO (Build-Own-Operate) contract. The
Senior Secured Notes were repaid in full in 2023.

vi. In relation to the acquisition of Linxon by the Company in 2018, the holder of the non-controlling interest of 49% in Linxon
granted an unsecured loan (the “Unsecured Loan”) and provided an unsecured working capital revolving credit facility to
Linxon. The Unsecured Loan in the principal amount of US$9.3 million (approximately CA$12.3 million)
(2022: approximately CA$12.7 million) is an interest-free loan and is repayable in full in September 2024 (2022:
September 2023). The working capital credit facility in a maximum aggregate amount of €30.0 million (approximately
CA$44.0 million) bore interest at a variable rate and was extinguished on September 30, 2022.
vii. The credit facility of TransitNEXT General Partnership in the aggregate maximum principal amount of $149.0 million
bears interest at a rate of CDOR plus an applicable margin and is repayable upon meeting certain conditions, but at the
latest in February 2024. The credit facility is secured by all assets of TransitNEXT. In addition, a wholly-owned entity
indirectly holding TransitNEXT entered into a term loan facility agreement. The aggregate principal amount of the term
loan facility is $99.7 million and cannot be drawn until substantial completion of the Trillium project is achieved. The term
loan facility bears interest at an annual rate of: i) 4.82% prior to August 10, 2026; and ii) CDOR plus an applicable margin
from and after August 10, 2026. The maturity of the term loan facility is the earlier of: i) the date that is 4 years after the
substantial completion date of the Trillium project; and ii) March 29, 2028. The term loan facility is secured by all assets of
such entity indirectly holding TransitNEXT and the interests and securities issued by the entity indirectly holding
TransitNEXT have also been pledged to the project lenders.

PROVISIONS (CONTINUED)

The expected timing of outflows of economic benefits relating to the Company’s provisions are as follows: i) most of the
provisions for legal proceedings and claims relate to matters that are subject to significant uncertainties, including uncertainties
over the timing of resolution, which could extend to several years; ii) forecasted losses on certain contracts are expected to be
incurred over the period of a contract duration, usually up to 3 years; iii) most of the accrued restructuring costs are expected to
be disbursed within the next 12 months for severance and up to 14 years for onerous contracts under lease arrangements;
iv) warranty expenditures are expected to take place within the next 5 years; and v) most of the other provisions are expected to
be resolved over the next 10 years. The main assumptions used to determine the provision for pension, other long-term benefits
and other post-employment benefits and other information, including the expected level of future funding payments in respect of
those arrangements, are given in Note 31.

SHARE CAPITAL (CONTINUED)

The terms and conditions of the DSU plan are as follows: each member of the Board of Directors of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.
(the “member”) receives an annual retainer consisting of: (a) a lump sum credited in DSU plan units, and (b) a cash award
payment. Each member may elect to receive 100% of the cash award payment, as well as 100% of their committee chair
retainer, meeting fees and travel fees, if applicable, in either cash or DSU plan units. DSU plan units track the price of common
shares of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They accumulate during a member’s term in office and are
redeemed in cash when the member leaves the Board of Directors. For the purposes of redeeming DSU plan units, the value of a
unit on any given date is equivalent to the average of the closing price for a common share on the Toronto Stock Exchange for
the five trading days immediately prior to such date. DSU plan units are credited on a quarterly basis and do not carry voting
rights. Furthermore, additional DSU plan units accumulate as dividend equivalents whenever cash dividends are paid on
common shares.

The Company has entered into derivative financial instruments with investment grade financial institutions to limit the
Company’s exposure to the variability of the units caused by fluctuations in its share price. The derivative financial instruments,
the fair value of which fluctuates in accordance with the movement in the Company’s share price, are required to be classified
as at FVTPL. As such, they are measured at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial position under “Other current
financial assets” (see Note 10) and “Other non-current financial assets” (see Note 15) if the fair value of a derivative financial
instrument is favourable or under “Other current financial liabilities” (see Note 17) and “Other non-current financial
liabilities” (see Note 20) if the fair value of a derivative financial instrument is unfavourable.
The compensation expense related to the share unit plans was $68.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023

GLOBAL MINIMUM TAX

In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) released a draft legislative
framework, followed by detailed guidance issued in March 2022, to assist in the implementation by participating jurisdictions of
a reform to the international tax system resulting in multinational enterprises with annual consolidated revenues exceeding a
certain threshold being subject to a minimum 15% effective tax rate collected via a “top-up tax” (the “Global Minimum Tax”).
Once changes to the tax laws in any jurisdiction in which AtkinsRéalis operates are enacted and in effect, AtkinsRéalis might be
subject to a top-up tax, collected in such jurisdiction(s). While there was no impact from the Global Minimum Tax in 2023 and
2022, the Company is closely monitoring the progress of the legislative process in each jurisdiction in which it operates.
The Company derives most of its consolidated revenues from the following three jurisdictions: the United Kingdom, Canada
and the United States. The progress of legislative process in each of these jurisdictions is as follows: (i) in July 2023, the United
Kingdom enacted new legislation to implement the Global Minimum Tax effective for the years beginning January 1, 2024 and
thereafter; (ii) in August 2023, Canada released draft Global Minimum Tax legislation, which could be enacted during the year
ending December 31, 2024, with a retrospective application to January 1, 2024; and (iii) the United States are not expected to
enact the Global Minimum Tax legislation in the near future; however, the Company’s operations in this jurisdiction are
expected to be within the scope of these rules for entities located in the United States, which are held directly or indirectly by
the Company’s holding entities in the United Kingdom and Canada.

INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

The Company also expects to be subject to the top-up tax for the years beginning January 1, 2024 and thereafter in countries
where the statutory tax rate is below 15% (most notably, the United Arab Emirates and Guernsey).
Due to the complexities in applying the Global Minimum Tax legislation, the quantitative impact of the enacted or substantively
enacted legislation is not yet reasonably estimable.
The Company has applied a temporary mandatory exception to recognizing and disclosing information about deferred income
tax assets and liabilities arising from jurisdictions implementing the Global Minimum Tax rules.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

B)

NATURE AND EXTENT OF RISKS ARISING FROM FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT

NATURE OF RISK

DESCRIPTION

Credit risk

Risk that AtkinsRéalis will incur a financial loss if the other party to a financial instrument fails to discharge an obligation. The
maximum exposure to credit risk for AtkinsRéalis at the end of a given period usually corresponds to the carrying amount of its financial
assets exposed to such risk, as presented in Note 29A.
Possibility that AtkinsRéalis will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities

Liquidity risk
Market risk

Variability in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument caused by a change in market prices in items such as currency
rates, interest rates and equity prices

CREDIT RISK

For AtkinsRéalis, credit risk arises from:
i)

Cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash, which are invested in liquid and high-grade financial instruments, based
on AtkinsRéalis’ investment policy.

ii) Derivative financial instruments with a favourable fair value, which contain an inherent credit risk relating to default
on obligations by the counterparty. This credit risk is reduced by entering into such contracts with high-grade financial
institutions, which are expected to satisfy their obligations under the contracts.
iii) Trade receivables, as detailed in Note 8, and contract assets. A given client may represent a material portion of
AtkinsRéalis’ consolidated revenues in any given year due to the size of a particular project and the progress
accomplished on such project.
The Company’s objective is to reduce its exposure to credit risk by converting its contract assets into trade receivables
on a timely basis and then ensuring collection of its trade receivables within satisfactory payment terms. The amounts
of trade receivables and contract assets presented in the consolidated statements of financial position are net of an
allowance for expected credit losses, estimated by the Company and based, in part, on the age of individual and
aggregated receivable balances, on the financial situation of specific customers and the current and expected collection
trends, based on the Company’s past experience, adjusted as needed to better reflect anticipated conditions.
Generally, trade receivables and contract assets are written off if they are no longer subject to enforcement activity. As
such, the amount of trade receivables and contract assets that have been written off but are still being pursued is
minimal.
The Company does not generally hold collateral as security.
iv) Other current financial assets, as detailed in Note 10, and other non-current financial assets, as detailed in Note 15. The
current portion of receivables under service concession arrangements is within normal terms of payment and there were
no significant amounts that were past due as at December 31, 2023 and 2022.
LIQUIDITY RISK

AtkinsRéalis monitors its liquidity risk arising from financial instruments on an ongoing basis by ensuring that it has access to
sufficient resources to meet its obligations.
The Company’s liquidity is generally provided by available cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, credit
facilities and access to capital markets, as needed. Due to the nature of the Company’s activities, the fact that its operations are
conducted through multiple entities and joint operations and that it operates in many countries, the Company’s cash and cash
equivalents are distributed across numerous locations. In order to manage its cash needs and reserves, the Company is part of
various cash pooling agreements with financial institutions, may transfer cash balances between subsidiaries and joint
arrangements and use credit facilities to meet the capital requirements of certain projects or other cash disbursements.
AtkinsRéalis’ consolidated statement of financial position included $171.0 million at December 31, 2023 (2022: $181.0 million)
of liabilities from Capital investments that are accounted for by the consolidation method. These liabilities, which are nonrecourse to the Company, are to be repaid by the Capital investments and are secured by the respective concession’s assets,
including $438.0 million of financial assets at December 31, 2023 (2022: $360.2 million), and by AtkinsRéalis’ shares or units
in such concession investments. As such, the actual book value at risk for AtkinsRéalis, assuming its Capital investments
accounted for by the consolidation method were to be unable to meet their obligations, corresponds to the carrying amount
invested in these entities.
AtkinsRéalis’ future principal payments on its short-term debt and long-term debt are presented in Note 19.

$1,825.9 million (2022: $1,704.4 million) had a maturity of not later than 1 year.
MARKET RISK
I) CURRENCY RISK

AtkinsRéalis’ foreign currency risk arises from arrangements in currencies other than its reporting currency and from the net
assets (liabilities) of its foreign operations.
The Company manages foreign currency risk by matching, when possible, the cash receipts in a foreign currency and the cash
disbursements in the same foreign currency, for revenue-generating projects in which foreign currencies are involved.
Derivative financial instruments with financial institutions, usually forward foreign exchange contracts, are also used to hedge
the cash flows in foreign currencies.
The following table summarizes the major forward foreign exchange contracts that were outstanding for which AtkinsRéalis has
committed to buy or sell foreign currencies:

As at December 31, 2023, a 10% appreciation in the Canadian dollar relative to: i) the US dollar would increase the Company’s
net income by $5.0 million (10% depreciation in the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar would decrease the Company’s
net income by $5.0 million); and ii) the British pound would decrease the Company’s net income by $3.7 million (10%
depreciation in the Canadian dollar relative to the British pound would increase the Company’s net income by $3.7 million).
II) INTEREST RATE RISK

Cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash, usually involve limited interest rate risk due to their short-term nature.
NON-RECOURSE DEBT

The credit facility of TransitNEXT General Partnership bears interest at a variable rate, which exposes the Company to interest
rate risk. Such risk has been reduced by the use of a hedging strategy until August 2022.
A subsidiary of the Company from PS&PM activities issued senior secured notes to finance certain long-term assets associated
to a BOO (Build-Own-Operate) contract. The Senior Secured Notes bore interest at a variable rate which exposed the Company
to interest rate risk until the repayment of these Senior Secured Notes by the Company in full in 2023. Also, in relation to the
acquisition of Linxon by the Company in 2018, the holder of non-controlling interest of 49% in Linxon granted an interest-free
loan and provided a working capital revolving credit facility to Linxon. The working capital revolving credit facility bore
interest at a variable rate which exposed the Company to interest rate risk until its extinguishment on September 30, 2022.
LIMITED RECOURSE DEBT

AtkinsRéalis’ limited recourse debt, being the CDPQ Loan, bears interest at a variable rate, which exposes the Company to
interest rate risk.
RECOURSE DEBT

AtkinsRéalis’ Revolving Facility bears interest at a variable rate, which exposes the Company to interest rate risk.
AtkinsRéalis’ Series 6 Debentures and Series 7 Debentures bear interest at a fixed rate and are measured at amortized cost;
therefore, the Company’s net income is not exposed to a change in interest rates on these financial liabilities.
AtkinsRéalis’ Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate which exposes the Company to interest rate risk, which was reduced in
2023 and 2022 due to the hedging by the Company of a portion of its Term Loan (see below).
AtkinsRéalis’ Series 4 Debentures bore interest at a variable rate, which exposed the Company to interest rate risk until the
repayment in full of these debentures in March 2023.
INTEREST RATE SWAPS

In 2023 and 2022, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions related to its variable
interest bearing Term Loan in the aggregate principal amount of $500 million. Under the interest rate swap agreements, the
Company pays interest at a fixed rate and receives interest at a variable rate on a total nominal amount of $375 million. The
interest rate swap agreements will expire in April 2025. This hedge is classified as a cash flow hedge.
TransitNEXT General Partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with financial institutions related to its credit
facility in the aggregate maximum principal amount of $149.0 million, which bears interest at a rate of CDOR plus an
applicable margin, to hedge the variability of the interest rate. Under the interest rate swap agreement, TransitNEXT paid
interest at a fixed rate and received interest at a rate of CDOR. The interest rate swap agreement expired in August 2022. This
hedge was classified as a cash flow hedge.

NOTES TO 2023 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

For floating rate debt and interest rate swaps, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the instrument outstanding at the
end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. A 1% (100 basis points) increase or decrease is used when
reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably
possible change in interest rates.
If, as at December 31, 2023, interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower than the base rate and all other variables were
held constant, the Company’s net income would decrease/increase by $7.8 million and the Company’s other components of
equity would increase/decrease by $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This is attributable to the Company’s
exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and its interest rate swaps.
III) EQUITY PRICE RISK

The Company limits its exposure arising from the share unit plans caused by fluctuations in its share price, through financial
arrangements with high investment grade financial institutions described in Note 22C.
C)

LETTERS OF CREDIT

Under certain circumstances, AtkinsRéalis provides bank letters of credit as collateral for the fulfillment of contractual
obligations, including guarantees for performance, advance payments, contractual retentions and bid bonds. The amount
outstanding under certain letters of credit decreases in relation to the percentage of completion of projects. As at
December 31, 2023, AtkinsRéalis had outstanding letters of credit of $1,742.9 million (2022: $1,573.7 million).

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

AtkinsRéalis’ main objective when managing its capital is to maintain an adequate balance between: i) having sufficient capital
for financing net asset positions, maintaining satisfactory bank lines of credit and capacity to absorb project net retained risks,
while at the same time, ii) maximizing return on equity.
The Company defines its capital as its equity attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders excluding other components of equity
plus its recourse debt. The Company excludes other components of equity from its definition of capital because this element of
equity results in part from the translation into Canadian dollars of its foreign operations having a different functional currency,
and from the accounting treatment of cash flow hedges, including its accumulated share of other comprehensive income of
investments accounted for by the equity method. These amounts are not representative of the way the Company evaluates the
management of its foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. Accordingly, the other components of equity are not
representative of the Company’s financial position.
The Company does not consider non-recourse and limited recourse debt when monitoring its capital because such debt results
from the consolidation of certain PS&PM investments and Capital investments or holding entities held by the Company. As
such, the lenders of such debt do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company, but rather to the specific assets of the
PS&PM investments and Capital investments or investment in Capital investments they finance. The Company’s investments
and underlying assets in its PS&PM investments and Capital investments accounted for by the consolidation or equity methods
may be at risk, if such investments or holding entities were to be unable to repay their long-term debt.
The Company’s capital for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:

The Company has paid quarterly dividends for 34 consecutive years. Dividend policy is determined by the Board of Directors of
the Company.
COVENANTS ON RECOURSE AND LIMITED RECOURSE DEBT

The Company’s unsecured recourse debentures are subject to affirmative and negative covenants, as defined in the underlying
indentures related thereto.
The Company’s Revolving Facility and Term Loan are committed and subject to various covenants, including financial
covenants, which comprise a requirement to maintain at all times, on a rolling 12-month basis, a net recourse debt to earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratio, as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement, not exceeding
a certain limit.
The CDPQ Loan is subject to various covenants, as well as financial covenants, notably not to exceed, on a rolling 12-month
and consolidated basis, a maximum net recourse debt to EBITDA ratio, as defined under the CDPQ Loan Agreement.
The terms “net recourse debt” and “EBITDA” are defined in each of the 2022 Credit Agreement and the CDPQ Loan
Agreement and do not correspond to the Company’s financial measures as presented above and/or to the specific terms used in
the Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2023.
In case of an event of default, the debentures, the Revolving Facility, the Term Loan and the CDPQ Loan are subject to
customary accelerated repayment terms.
In 2023, the Company complied with all of the covenants, as amended from time to time, related to its debentures, the
Revolving Facility, the Term Loan and the CDPQ Loan.

PENSION PLANS, OTHER LONG-TERM BENEFITS AND OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

A)

PENSION PLANS

AtkinsRéalis has defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. The total cash amount paid by AtkinsRéalis for its
pension plans, consisting of contributions to its defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans, was $232.2 million in
2023 (2022: $269.1 million).
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLANS

AtkinsRéalis’ contributions to its defined contribution plans are recorded as expenses in the year in which they are incurred and
totaled $180.1 million in 2023 (2022: $169.1 million).
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

AtkinsRéalis has a number of defined benefit pension plans, which are mostly closed to new entrants, and that provide pension
benefits based on length of service and final pensionable earnings. An individual actuarial valuation is performed at least every
three years for all the plans. The measurement date used for the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31 of each year.
All of AtkinsRéalis’ defined benefit pension plans are partly funded, except for two plans, of which one plan is unfunded and
one plan is secured by a letter of credit.
The defined benefit plans are administered by committees composed of a number of representatives from employer’s
representatives, active employees, inactive employees and independent members. Members of the committees are required by
law and by their articles of association to act in the best interest of the pension plans and all their relevant stakeholders, i.e.
active employees, inactive employees, retirees and employers. The pension plan committees are responsible for the investment
policy with regard to the assets of the pension plans, which are held by a trustee legally separated from AtkinsRéalis.
AtkinsRéalis’ defined benefit pension plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest
rate risk, compensation risk and longevity risk.
NATURE OF RISK

DESCRIPTION

Investment risk

The present value of the defined benefit pension plan obligation is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to
high quality corporate bond yields; if the return on the plans’ assets is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.

Interest rate risk

A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plans’ liabilities and the return on the plans’ debt securities.

Compensation risk

The present value of the defined benefit pension plan obligation is calculated by reference to the final pensionable earnings of
the plans’ participants.

Longevity risk

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of the plans’
participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plans’ participants will increase
the plans’ liability.

The two main defined benefit pension plans of the Company are the Atkins Pension Plan and the U.K. Railways Pension
Scheme (the “Railways Pension Scheme”), both of which are funded final salary schemes in the U.K.

The weighted average rate of compensation increase for other plans, excluding pension plans for which benefits are not linked to future salary levels,

(2)

The inflation assumption shown for Atkins Pension Plan and the Railways Pension Scheme is for the Retail Price Index. The assumption for the Consumer
Price Index was 2.57% as at December 31, 2022.

The sensitivity analysis below was determined based on reasonable possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at
December 31, 2023, while holding all other assumptions constant.
If the discount rate is 100 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit pension obligation would decrease by an estimated
amount of $321.0 million (increase by an estimated amount of $322.8 million).
If the rate of compensation increase is 100 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit pension obligation would increase by
an estimated amount of $4.0 million (decrease by an estimated amount of $4.0 million).
If the rate of inflation is 100 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit pension obligation would increase by an estimated
amount of $202.1 million (decrease by an estimated amount of $202.1 million).
If longevity increases by 1 year, the defined benefit pension obligation would increase by an estimated amount of
$140.3 million.
The sensitivity analyses presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit pension
obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions
may be correlated. Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analyses, the present value of the defined benefit pension
obligation was calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same method
applied in calculating the liability arising from the defined benefit pension obligation recognized in the statement of financial
position.
The weighted average duration of the pension benefit obligation as at December 31, 2023 was 14.0 years for the Atkins Pension
Plan (2022: 14.0 years), 12.4 years for Railways Pension Scheme (2022: 13.2 years) and 14.9 years for the other plans
(2022: 15.4 years).
B)

OTHER LONG-TERM BENEFITS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

AtkinsRéalis has a number of other long-term benefit and other post-employment benefit plans, which are all defined benefit
plans and include mainly termination indemnities, medical and dental care benefits, and life insurance benefits. AtkinsRéalis’
other long-term benefit and other post-employment benefit plans are unfunded plans.
AtkinsRéalis’ net defined other long-term benefit and other post-employment benefit costs recognized in net income amounted
to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2022: $15.7 million) and benefit costs recognized in other
comprehensive income amounted to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2022: reversal of benefit costs of
$0.1 million). As at December 31, 2023, the obligation for other long-term benefits and other post-employment benefits, which
is included in “Provisions” in the consolidated statement of financial position, amounted to $72.3 million (2022: $51.4 million).

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Class actions
Ruediger Class Action
On February 6, 2019, a Motion for authorization of a class action and for authorization to bring an action against the Company
and certain of its directors and officers (collectively, the “Ruediger Defendants”) pursuant to section 225.4 of the Securities Act
(Québec) (the “Ruediger Class Action”) was filed with the Superior Court of Québec, on behalf of persons who acquired the
Company’s securities from February 22, 2018 through January 27, 2019 (the “Ruediger Class Period”) and held some or all of
such securities as of the commencement of trading on January 28, 2019.
The Ruediger Class Action alleges that certain documents filed by the Company and oral statements made by its then Chief
Executive Officer during the Ruediger Class Period contained misrepresentations related to the Company’s revenue forecasts
and to the financial performance of the former Mining & Metallurgy segment and the former Oil & Gas segment, which
misrepresentations would have been corrected by way of the Company’s January 28, 2019 press release.
The Ruediger Class Action seeks leave from the Québec Superior Court to bring a statutory misrepresentation claim under the
Securities Act (Québec). The plaintiff in the proposed action claims damages and seeks the condemnation of the Ruediger
Defendants to pay the class members an unspecified amount for compensatory damages with interest and additional indemnity
as well as full costs and expenses, including expert fees, notice fees and fees relating to administering the plan of distribution.
On October 15, 2019, the plaintiffs in the Ruediger Class Action delivered an amended “Motion for authorization of a class
action and for authorization to bring an action pursuant to section 225.4 of Québec’s Securities Act”. The amendments extend
the Ruediger Class Period to July 22, 2019 and broaden the scope of the claim to include, among other things, disclosure alleged
to have been made regarding the Company’s ability to execute certain fixed price contracts.
On October 20, 2021, a class action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice pertaining to facts similar to those in the Ruediger
Class Action (the “Drywall Class Action”) was dismissed and the claimants in the Drywall Class Action were consequently
entitled to have their claims included in the Ruediger Class Action.
The authorization hearing on the amended Ruediger Class Action occurred in April 2022 and, on October 11, 2022, the Québec
Superior Court ruled dismissing the Ruediger Class Action, as amended, on all grounds. On November 18, 2022, the plaintiffs
appealed the ruling to the Québec Court of Appeal. The appeal was heard on January 17, 2024 and final judgment is expected to
be rendered in the second half of 2024.
The Company believes that the claims outlined in the Ruediger Class Action are, in each case, entirely without merit and is
vigorously defending these claims. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, it is not possible to predict the final outcomes
of the Ruediger Class Action or to determine the amount of any potential losses resulting therefrom, if any, and the Company
may, in the future, be subject to further class action lawsuits or other litigation. The Company has directors’ and officers’
liability insurance insuring individuals against liability for acts or omissions in their capacity as directors and officers, and the
Company itself has coverage for such claims. The amount of coverage under the directors’ and officers’ policy is limited and
such coverage may be less than any amounts the Company is required or determines to pay in connection with these
proceedings. If the Company is required or determines to pay an amount in connection with the Ruediger Class Action, such
amount could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and financial results.
Peters Class Action
On February 25, 2019, a Notice of action was issued with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice by a proposed representative
plaintiff, Mr. John Peters, on behalf of persons who acquired the Company securities from September 4, 2018 through
October 10, 2018. On March 25, 2019, a Statement of Claim was filed with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice with respect to
the claims set out in the Notice of Action (together, the Notice of Action and the Statement of Claim are referred to as the
“Peters Class Action”).
The Peters Class Action alleged that the defendants, including the Company, the then chair of its Board of Directors and certain
of its then officers, failed to make timely disclosure of a material change in the business, operations or capital of the Company,
by failing to disclose that on September 4, 2018, the Director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada communicated her
decision to the Company not to award an opportunity to negotiate a remediation agreement.
The Peters Class Action sought leave from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to bring a statutory misrepresentation claim
under the Securities Act (Ontario) and the comparable securities legislation in other provinces and asserted a claim for common
law negligent misrepresentation. The Peters Class Action claimed damages in the sum of $75 million or such other amount as
the Superior Court may determine plus interest and costs.

On March 5, 2020, the plaintiff in the Peters Class Action brought a motion for leave and certification of the Peters Class
Action. The leave and certification hearing was held between June 1 and June 3, 2021 and, on July 16, 2021, the court dismissed
the Peters Class Action. The Plaintiff appealed the ruling and the appeal hearing was held on November 8, 2022. The Court of
Appeal delivered its judgment on May 24, 2023 dismissing the appeal. The Plaintiff has not sought leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court and this matter is resolved with the lawsuit having been definitively dismissed.
Pyrrhotite case
On June 12, 2014, the Québec Superior Court rendered a decision in “Wave 1” of the matter commonly referred to as the
“Pyrrhotite Case” in Trois-Rivières, Québec and in which the Company was one of numerous defendants. The Québec Superior
Court ruled in favour of the plaintiffs, awarding an aggregate amount of approximately $168 million in damages apportioned
amongst the then-known defendants, on a solidary (in solidum) basis (the “Wave 1 claims”). The Québec Superior Court ruled
that the Company’s share of the damages award was approximately 70%. The Company’s external insurers disputed the extent
of the insurance coverage available to the Company and this dispute was included in the Pyrrhotite Case. The Company, among
other parties, appealed the Québec Superior Court’s ruling and, on April 6, 2020, the Québec Court of Appeal rendered its
decision dismissing most of the appeals filed by all parties and upheld: (i) the Québec Superior Court’s ruling regarding the
Company’s approximate 70% share of liability; and (ii) the solidary nature of the defendants’ liability. In a further ruling, on
June 12, 2020, the Québec Court of Appeal confirmed the Company’s allocated share of the damages, inclusive of interest and
costs at approximately $200 million, and the Company paid this amount of damages awarded to the plaintiffs on
August 3, 2020. The Company filed a notice seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
The Québec Court of Appeal also dismissed an appeal from the Company’s external insurers and confirmed that multiple
insurance policy towers were triggered by the Wave 1 claims, resulting in multiple years of coverage. The Company’s external
insurers filed notices seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
On May 6, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed both the Company’s and its external insurers’ applications seeking
leave to appeal.
Given that the Company’s external insurers initially refused to comply with terms contained in the relevant policies of insurance
and the orders of the Québec Superior Court and the Québec Court of Appeal requiring them to pay a substantial portion of the
$200 million damages award, the Company filed an application with the Québec Superior Court seeking an order requiring the
Company’s external insurers to comply with the Québec Court of Appeal’s order and facilitate execution of the $200 million
damages award by way of the multiple towers of insurance. On October 16, 2020, the Québec Superior Court ruled in favour of
the Company ordering the Company’s external insurers to pay the Company approximately $141 million, which was fully
collected. An additional $33 million in insurance proceeds was also collected by the Company through a reinsurance policy
which was not subject to this court ruling.
The Company filed a recourse in warranty claim against Lafarge Canada Inc. (“Lafarge”) seeking its contribution to the
damages awarded against the Company in the Wave 1 judgment. The trial commenced in March 2019 and concluded in 2020.
On February 4, 2021, the Québec Superior Court dismissed the Company’s claim and the Company appealed the Québec
Superior Court’s ruling to the Québec Court of Appeal. The appeal was heard between November 8 and 10, 2022 and, on
July 14, 2023, the Court of Appeal upheld the first instance decision. The Company filed its application for leave to appeal this
decision to the Supreme Court of Canada on September 29, 2023. A decision on leave is not expected before the second half of
2024.
In parallel to the Wave 1 claims, notices of additional potential claims have been made and continue to be made against certain
defendants, including the Company, in “Wave 2” of the Pyrrhotite Case. In April 2022, the parties, including most of the
Company’s external insurers, reached a settlement concerning Wave 2 claims that relate to certain residential buildings. The
Company’s portion of the settlement in capital and interest totaled $60.9 million, of which the uninsured portion was
$25.7 million. On June 27, 2023, the court approved a settlement between the parties, including most of the Company’s external
insurers, concerning various multi-apartment claims and certain commercial claims. The Company’s and its insurers’ portion of
the settlement in capital, interest and fees totaled $17.6 million, of which the uninsured portion was $7.1 million. These
settlements did not have an impact on the Company’s financial results as their outcomes were covered by the amounts
previously provisioned for by the Company. The Company’s liability exposure for the remaining Wave 2 claims remains subject
to several uncertainties. In addition, the Company has filed a separate recourse in warranty claim against Lafarge with respect to
the Wave 2 claims.

Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac Case
This case pertains to a class action authorized on April 18, 2023 brought against the City of Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac
(the “City”) and the Attorney General of Quebec seeking reparation for all the citizens of the City who were affected by
floodings due to the breach of a surrounding dike. AECOM, the successor of the engineering firm Gendron, Lefebvre et
Associés (“GLA”), is a defendant in warranty and has called AtkinsRéalis Canada Inc. in rear warranty. The Company’s
involvement stems from the acquisition of Laboratoire de Béton Ltée (“LDB”), a subcontractor to GLA between 1979 and 1982.
Although LDB’s exact role remains to be defined, it is alleged that it was responsible for the quality control of the materials and
of the borrow pits from where the clay required in the construction process was extracted. Each member of the class action
claims up to 350 thousand dollars. The actual number of members remains to be determined but is currently estimated at 1,000.
There are also separate actions in respect of 16 individual files where the same defendants are named and where a total amount
of $31.5 million is being claimed. These cases are under a special case management and are separate from the class action as in
Québec, plaintiffs have the choice to join a class action or file separately.
Dubai civil case
In November 2018, WS Atkins & Partners Overseas, a subsidiary of the Company, was named as defendant together with other
parties by the subrogated insurers of a property developer in a civil case initiated before the courts of Dubai. The claimant
sought damages jointly from the defendants on account of the alleged refurbishment costs and loss of income arising from a fire
at the property developer’s building. WS Atkins & Partners Overseas was a subcontractor in the hotel’s design and construction
supervision and the claim revolved around alleged negligence in the specification, testing and installation of the building
cladding, which was claimed to have exacerbated the fire, thereby increasing the damage to the building. In a first instance court
ruling in 2021, the claim was dismissed against all defendants including WS Atkins & Partners Overseas. The claimant filed an
appeal, and on September 14, 2022, the court dismissed the claimant’s appeal. On November 14, 2022, the claimant filed a
further appeal to the Court of Cassation (Dubai’s highest tribunal). WS Atkins & Partners Overseas objected to the appeal on
December 5, 2022, alongside the other defendants. The appeal before the Court of Cassation was heard on August 17, 2023 and
was dismissed on August 24, 2023 such that this matter is resolved with the lawsuit having been definitively dismissed as
against all defendants, including WS Atkins & Partners Overseas.
Australian Arbitration
One of the Company’s former subsidiaries, divested as part of the sale of the Company’s Oil & Gas business, had a 35% interest
in a joint operation for a project that has been completed. The construction joint operation is in a dispute with the project owner
over labour rates. Pursuant to the agreement to sell the Oil & Gas business, the Company has retained the divested subsidiary’s
risk associated with, and conduct of, this dispute. Under the relevant project contract, the subsidiary is jointly and severally
liable with the other joint operator vis-à-vis the project owner for performance and other liabilities. In December 2018, the joint
operation received a split award of liability from an arbitration tribunal resulting in an adverse decision on certain aspects of the
dispute. In August 2020, a hearing on residual legal issues occurred and, in September 2020, the tribunal ruled in favour of the
joint operation. The ruling was challenged by the project owner and a court hearing occurred in June 2021 and, on
September 28, 2021, the court found in favor of the project owner effectively reversing the September 2020 tribunal ruling. The
joint operation appealed the September 2021 court ruling and the appeal hearing occurred in September 2022. On
January 17, 2023, the court dismissed the joint operation’s appeal, and the joint operation then filed an application to the
Australian High Court seeking leave to appeal the ruling. The High Court of Australia granted Special Leave to Appeal on
November 17, 2023 and the appeal will be heard on April 16, 2024, with a decision likely to be rendered in the second half of
2024. The arbitration on quantum will likely resume in 2025.
General litigation risk
Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, it is not possible to (a) predict the final outcome of these and other related
proceedings generally, (b) determine if the amount included in the Company’s provisions is sufficient, or (c) determine the
amount of potential losses, if any, that may be incurred in connection with any final judgment on these matters.
The Company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations. The Company’s insurance
programs have varying coverage limits and maximums, and insurance companies may deny claims the Company might make. In
addition, the Company has elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits and
retentions under these programs. As a result, the Company may be subject to future liability in respect of lawsuits or
investigations for which it is only partially insured, or completely uninsured.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)

In addition, the nature of the Company’s business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors and suppliers presenting claims
for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. Similarly, the Company occasionally presents change
orders and other claims to clients, subcontractors, and suppliers. If the Company fails to properly issue the change orders or
other claims, or fails to document the nature of claims and change orders or is otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable
settlements with clients, subcontractors and suppliers, the Company could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases,
a loss for a project. A failure to recover promptly on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on the
Company’s liquidity and financial results. Additionally, irrespective of how well the Company documents the nature of its
claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant.
In addition, a number of project contracts have warranty periods and/or outstanding claims that may result in legal proceedings
that extend beyond the actual performance and completion of the projects.
Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavourable rulings can and do occur. Pending
or future claims against the Company could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty
obligations, and other liabilities which, to the extent the Company is not insured against a loss or its insurer fails to provide
coverage, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Jacques Cartier Bridge Criminal Charges (Canada)
On September 23, 2021, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the “RCMP”), represented by the Province of Québec’s Directeur
des Poursuites Criminelles et Pénales (“DPCP”), laid charges against the Company’s subsidiary, SNC-Lavalin Inc. and its
indirect subsidiary, SNC-Lavalin International Inc. Each entity was jointly charged (along with a former employee of the
Company, Normand Morin) with the following counts: 1) forgery under Section 366 of the Criminal Code (Canada) (the
“Criminal Code”), 2) fraud under Section 380 of the Criminal Code, and 3) fraud against the government under Section 121 of
the Criminal Code. Each entity was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit the aforementioned crimes (the “Criminal
Charges”). On the same date, the DPCP gave notice to SNC-Lavalin Inc. and SNC-Lavalin International Inc. of an invitation to
negotiate a remediation agreement in accordance with Part XXII.1. of the Criminal Code with respect to the Criminal Charges,
and on October 1, 2021, both entities formally accepted the invitation. These Criminal Charges follow the RCMP’s formal
investigation relating to alleged payments in connection with a 2002 contract for the refurbishment of the Jacques Cartier Bridge
by a consortium which included SNC-Lavalin Inc. and which previously led to a guilty plea on certain criminal charges in 2017
by the former head of the Canada Federal Bridges Corporation. Another former employee of the Company, Kamal Francis, was
also charged separately with similar offenses.
SNC-Lavalin Inc. and SNC-Lavalin International Inc. reached agreement on the terms of the remediation agreement and, on
May 11, 2022, the Québec Superior Court issued an order approving the remediation agreement (the “Remediation
Agreement”). The Remediation Agreement has a three-year term, and requires a total payment of $29.6 million payable over
three years as well as the appointment of a monitor for a three-year period, amongst other obligations. The Company estimated
the net present value of these installments at $27.4 million at May 11, 2022, which was included in “DPCP Remediation
Agreement expense” in the consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Criminal Charges are
suspended during the term of the Remediation Agreement, and, upon its expiry, provided the terms will have been complied
with and subject to Court approval, the Criminal Charges will be dismissed. Also on May 11, 2022, the Company entered into
an administrative agreement with Public Services and Procurement Canada allowing the Company to continue to do business
with the Canadian federal government and federal departments and agencies under the auspices of the federal Integrity Regime
despite the Criminal Charges being suspended pursuant to the Remediation Agreement.
The Company cannot predict what, if any, other actions may be taken by any other applicable government or authority or the
Company’s customers or other third parties as a result of the Criminal Charges.
Ongoing and potential investigations
The Company is subject to ongoing investigations that could subject the Company to criminal and administrative enforcement
actions, civil actions and sanctions, fines and other penalties, some of which may be significant. These investigations, and
potential results thereof, could harm the Company’s reputation, result in suspension, prohibition or debarment of the Company
from participating in certain projects, reduce its revenues and net income and adversely affect its business.
The Company understands that there are investigations by various authorities which may remain ongoing in connection with
certain legacy matters in various jurisdictions, including, without limitation, Algeria, Brazil and Angola.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)

The Company is currently unable to determine when any of these investigations will be completed or whether other
investigations of the Company by these or other authorities will be initiated or the scope of current investigations broadened or
result in legal proceedings against the Company. The Company continues to cooperate and communicate with authorities in
connection with all ongoing investigations.
If regulatory, enforcement or administrative authorities or third parties determine to take action against the Company or to
sanction the Company in connection with possible violations of law, contracts or otherwise as a result of ongoing or future
investigations, the consequences of any such sanctions or other actions, whether actual or alleged, could require the Company to
pay material fines or damages, consent to restrictions on future conduct or lead to other penalties, including temporary or
permanent, mandatory or discretionary suspension, prohibition or debarment from participating in projects, or the revocation of
authorizations or certifications, by certain administrative organizations or by governments (such as the Government of Canada
and/or the Government of Québec) under applicable procurement laws, regulations, policies or practices. The Company derives
a significant percentage of its annual consolidated revenue from government and government-related contracts. Further, public
and private sector bid processes in some instances assess whether the bidder, or an affiliate thereof, has ever been the object of
any investigations, or sanctions or other actions resulting therefrom. In such instances, if the Company or one of its subsidiaries
or investee entities must answer affirmatively to a query as to past or current investigations, or sanctions or other actions
resulting therefrom, such answer may affect that entity’s ability to be considered for the applicable project. In addition, the
Company may not win contracts that it has bid upon due to a client’s perception of the Company’s reputation and/or perceived
reputational advantages held by competitors as a result of such investigations, sanctions or other actions. Loss of bidding
opportunities resulting from such investigations, sanctions or other actions, whether discretionary (including as a result of
reputational factors) or mandatory, from participating in certain government, government-related and private contracts (in
Canada, Canadian provinces or elsewhere) could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and
liquidity and the market price of the Company’s issued and traded securities.
The outcomes of ongoing or future investigations could also result in, among other things, (i) covenant defaults under various
project contracts, (ii) third party claims, which may include claims for special, indirect, derivative or consequential damages, or
(iii) adverse consequences on the Company’s ability to secure or continue its own financing, or to continue or secure financing
for current or future projects, any of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and
liquidity and the market price of the Company’s issued and traded securities. In addition, these investigations and outcomes of
these investigations and any negative publicity associated therewith could damage the Company’s reputation and ability to do
business.
Due to the uncertainties related to the outcome of ongoing or future investigations, the Company is currently unable to reliably
estimate an amount of potential liabilities or a range of potential liabilities, if any, in connection with any of these investigations.
The Company’s senior management and Board of Directors have been required to devote significant time and resources to the
investigations described above and ongoing related matters, as well as the investigations leading to the settlements described
above, which have distracted and may continue to distract senior management and the Board of Directors from the conduct of
the Company’s daily business, and significant expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in connection with such
investigations including substantial fees of lawyers and other advisors. In addition, the Company and/or its employees or former
employees could become the subject of these or other investigations by law enforcement and/or regulatory authorities in respect
of the matters described above or below, or other matters, which, in turn, could require the devotion of additional time of senior
management and the diversion or utilization of other resources.
Other legal proceedings
The Company becomes involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business and this section describes
important ordinary course of business legal proceedings, including the general cautionary language relating to the risks inherent
to all litigation and proceedings against the Company, which is equally applicable to the legal proceedings described below.
The Company has initiated court proceedings against a Canadian client stemming from engineering, procurement and
construction management services that the Company provided in relation to the client’s expansion of an ore-processing facility.
The Company claimed from the client certain amounts due under the project contract. The client has counter-claimed alleging
that the Company defaulted under the project contracts and is seeking damages.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)

The Company has initiated court proceedings in Qatar against a main contractor stemming from its involvement in a consortium
that was a sub-contractor for mechanical, electrical and plumbing services in relation to the construction of a hospital. The
Company claimed from the main contractor certain amounts due under the sub-contract. The Company’s consortium partner has
also initiated court proceedings against the main contractor claiming certain amounts due to it under the sub-contract. The main
contractor has counter-claimed alleging that the Company and its consortium partner defaulted under the sub-contract and is
seeking damages.
Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, it is not possible to (a) predict the final outcome of this and other legal
proceedings generally, (b) determine if the amount included in the Company’s provisions is sufficient, or (c) determine the
amount of potential losses, if any, that may be incurred in connection with any final judgment on these matters.
The Company is a party to other claims and litigation arising in the normal course of operations, including by clients,
subcontractors, and suppliers presenting claims for, amongst other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. Due to
the inherent uncertainties of litigation and/or the early stage of certain proceedings, it is not possible to predict the final outcome
of all ongoing claims and litigation at any given time or to determine the amount of any potential losses, if any. With respect to
claims or litigation arising in the normal course of operations which are at a more advanced stage and which permit a better
assessment of potential outcome, the Company does not expect the resolution of these matters to have a material adverse effect
on its financial position or results of operations.

NOTES TO 2023 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
February 29, 2024
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is designed to provide the reader with a greater understanding
of the business of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (doing business under the name “AtkinsRéalis”), the business strategy
and performance, as well as how it manages risk and capital resources. It is intended to enhance the
understanding of the Company’s 2023 audited annual consolidated financial statements (the “2023 Annual
Financial Statements”) and accompanying notes, and should therefore be read in conjunction with these
documents, and should also be read together with the text below on forward-looking statements.
References in this MD&A to the “Company”, “AtkinsRéalis”, “SNC-Lavalin”, “we”, “us” and “our” mean, as the
context may require, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. and all or some of its subsidiaries or joint arrangements or
associates, or SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. or one or more of its subsidiaries or joint arrangements or associates.
Unless otherwise specified, references herein to “Sections” are to Sections of this MD&A.
The Company’s quarterly and annual financial information, its Annual Information Form, its Management Proxy
Circular, other financial documents and additional information relating to the Company are available on both the
Company’s website at www.atkinsrealis.com and through SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com. SEDAR+ is the
electronic system for the official filing of documents by public companies with the Canadian securities regulatory
authorities. None of the information contained on, or connected to, the AtkinsRéalis website is incorporated by
reference into or otherwise forms part of this MD&A.
Unless otherwise indicated, all financial information presented in this MD&A, including tabular amounts, is in
Canadian dollars and is prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
Certain totals, subtotals and percentages may not reconcile due to rounding. Not applicable (“N/A”) is

Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Ratios, Supplementary
Financial Measures and Non-Financial Information
Certain indicators used by the Company to analyze and evaluate its results, which are listed in the table below,
are non-IFRS financial measures or ratios, supplementary financial measures or non-financial information.
Consequently, they do not have a standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be
comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Management believes that, in addition to
conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, these non-IFRS financial measures and ratios, and
certain supplementary financial measures and non-financial information, provide additional insight into the
Company’s financial results and certain investors may use this information to evaluate the Company’s
performance from period to period. However, these measures, ratios and non-financial information have
limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in
accordance with IFRS.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Forward-Looking Statements
Statements made in this MD&A that describe the Company’s or management’s budgets, estimates, expectations,
forecasts, objectives, predictions, projections of the future or strategies may be “forward-looking statements”,
which can be identified by the use of the conditional or forward-looking terminology such as “aims”, “anticipates”,
“assumes”, “believes”, “cost savings”, “estimates”, “expects”, “forecasts”, “goal”, “intends”, “likely”, “may”,
“objective”, “outlook”, “plans”, “projects”, “should”, “synergies”, “target”, “vision”, “will”, or the negative thereof or
other variations thereon. Forward-looking statements also include any other statements that do not refer to
historical facts. Forward-looking statements in this MD&A and in the Company’s other public disclosure
documents include statements relating to the Company’s future economic performance and financial condition, as
well as the Company’s objectives and targets, including with respect to the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions
reduction forecast and targets, and the Company’s diversity targets. Forward-looking statements also include
statements relating to the following: i) future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, economic
performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, project or contract-specific cost reforecasts and claims
provisions, and future prospects; and ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of
the Company’s operations. All such forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the “safe-harbour”
provisions of applicable Canadian securities laws. The Company cautions that, by their nature, forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties, and that its actual actions and/or results could differ materially from
those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements, or could affect the extent to which a particular
projection materializes. Forward-looking statements are presented for the purpose of assisting investors and
others in understanding certain key elements of the Company’s current objectives, strategic priorities,
expectations and plans, and in obtaining a better understanding of the Company’s business and anticipated
operating environment. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.
Forward-looking statements made in this MD&A and the Company’s other public disclosure documents are based
on a number of assumptions believed by the Company to be reasonable on February 29, 2024. The assumptions
are set out throughout this MD&A (particularly in the sections entitled “Critical Accounting Judgements and Key
Sources of Estimation Uncertainty” and “How We Analyze and Report Our Results”).
The assumptions regarding the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction forecast are based on the
Company’s current strategic plan, geographic footprint, mix of lines of business and overall size and scope of
operations. The Company’s commitments, targets and actions regarding the proportion of women in leadership
are based on a number of assumptions, including, without limitation, the following material assumptions: the
Company’s ability to leverage partnerships and recruitment agencies to help identify qualified diverse talent for
vacant positions and sufficient diverse labour market availability.
If these assumptions are inaccurate, the Company’s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or
implied in such forward-looking statements. In addition, important risk factors could cause the Company’s
assumptions and estimates to be inaccurate and actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed
in or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks include, but are not limited to, matters relating to:
(a) fixed-price contracts or the Company’s failure to meet contractual schedule, performance requirements or to
execute projects efficiently; (b) backlog and contracts with termination for convenience provisions; (c) contract
awards and timing; (d) being a provider of services to government agencies; (e) international operations;
(f) nuclear liability; (g) ownership interests in investments; (h) dependence on third parties; (i) supply chain
disruptions; (j) joint arrangements and partnerships; (k) information systems and data and compliance with privacy
legislation; (l) artificial intelligence (“AI”) and other innovative technologies; (m) qualified personnel; (n) strategic
direction; (o) competition; (p) professional liability or liability for faulty services; (q) monetary damages and
penalties in connection with professional and engineering reports and opinions; (r) gaps in insurance coverage;
(s) health and safety; (t) work stoppages, union negotiations and other labour matters; (u) epidemics, pandemics
and other health crises (v) global climate change, extreme weather conditions and the impact of natural or other
disasters; (w) environmental, social and governance (“ESG”); (x) divestitures and the sale of significant assets;
(y) intellectual property; (z) liquidity and financial position; (aa) indebtedness; (bb) impact of operating results and
level of indebtedness on financial situation; (cc) security under the CDPQ Loan Agreement (as hereinafter
defined); (dd) dependence on subsidiaries to help repay indebtedness; (ee) dividends; (ff) post-employment
benefit obligations, including pension-related obligations; (gg) working capital requirements; (hh) collection from

Company of legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and dispute settlements; (kk) employee, agent or
partner misconduct or failure to comply with anti-corruption and other government laws and regulations;

laws and regulations; (oo) global economic conditions; (pp) inflation; (qq) fluctuations in commodity prices; and
(rr) income taxes.
The Company cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. For more information on risks and
uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ from current expectations,
please refer to the sections “Risks and Uncertainties”, “How We Analyze and Report Our Results” and “Critical
Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty” in this MD&A.
The Company may, from time to time, make oral forward-looking statements. The Company advises that the
above paragraphs and the risk factors described in this MD&A should be considered for a description of certain
factors that could cause the actual results of the Company to differ materially from those in the oral forwardlooking statements. The forward-looking statements herein reflect the Company’s expectations as at
February 29, 2024, the date on which the Company’s Board of Directors approved this MD&A, and they are
subject to change after such date. The Company does not undertake to update publicly or to revise any written or
oral forward-looking information or statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise,
unless required by applicable legislation or regulation. The forward-looking information and statements contained
herein are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.

1.1

DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS

On September 12, 2023, the Company announced that it had rebranded to AtkinsRéalis. The name AtkinsRéalis
is a created term that combines Atkins, a legacy brand that is well-established across the Company’s international
markets, and “Réalis”, inspired by the city of Montréal and the Company’s French-Canadian roots. “Réalis” also
resembles the verb “to realize” or “to make happen” which emphasizes the Company’s focus on outcomes and
project delivery. The Company intends to submit to shareholders at its 2024 annual meeting of shareholders a
special resolution to approve its change of corporate legal name from “SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.” to
“AtkinsRéalis Group Inc.”.
Created by the integration of long-standing organizations dating back to 1911, AtkinsRéalis is a world-leading
professional services and project management company dedicated to engineering a better future for our planet
and its people. The Company creates sustainable solutions that connect people, data and technology to transform
the world’s infrastructure and energy systems. The Company deploys global capabilities locally to its clients and
delivers unique end-to-end services across the whole life cycle of an asset including consulting, advisory &
environmental services, intelligent networks & cybersecurity, design & engineering, procurement, project &
construction management, operations & maintenance (“O&M”), decommissioning and capital.
In certain parts of this MD&A, activities from Professional Services & Project Management are collectively referred
to as “PS&PM” to distinguish them from “Capital” activities. PS&PM groups together five of the Company’s
segments, namely Engineering Services, Nuclear, O&M, Linxon and lump-sum turnkey (“LSTK”) Projects, while
Capital is its own reportable segment and separate from PS&PM.
Contracts that provide for engineering, procurement and construction management services are often referred to
as “EPCM” contracts. Contracts that include engineering services, providing materials and providing or fabricating
equipment, and construction activities are often referred to as “EPC” contracts.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

1.2

NEW OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE

Beginning in 2024, AtkinsRéalis has evolved and implemented a new operational structure to unify and simplify
the Company in the regions where it operates. Under the new structure, the Engineering Services and O&M
segments will be merged and managed by region. Therefore, the Segment disclosure in the Company’s 2024
financial statements and MD&A will include, under Engineering Services Regions:
◦

Canada, including the existing O&M contracts in Algeria which are managed by the Canadian leadership
team;

◦

United Kingdom and Ireland (“UKI”);

◦

United States and Latin America (“USLA”), including the global activities of Minerals & Metals; and

◦

Asia, Middle East and Australia (“AMEA”).

The Nuclear, Linxon, LSTK Projects and Capital segments will continue to report their results on a stand-alone
basis.
In addition, to drive margin expansion and operational excellence through the development, optimization, and
deployment of AtkinsRéalis’ global capabilities, a permanent Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) office has been
created.
In 2024, the Company will restate its 2023 comparative financial information of segment results to conform with its
new reporting structure. As such, reconciliations of the segment results under the current reporting structure and
the new reporting structure for the year ended December 31, 2023 and four quarters of 2023 are provided in
Section 13.5 of this MD&A.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

How We Analyze and Report Our Results
2.1

HOW WE REPORT OUR RESULTS

The Company presents its financial information consistent with the manner in which management evaluates
performance by grouping its activities in six reportable segments, namely: (i) Engineering Services; (ii) Nuclear;
(iii) O&M; (iv) Linxon; (v) LSTK Projects; and (vi) Capital.
In addition, the Company further reports certain results and provides certain financial information separately for
(i) PS&PM activities, which is comprised of five of its six segments, namely Engineering Services,
Nuclear, O&M, Linxon and LSTK Projects, and (ii) Capital.
PS&PM
What is reported in PS&PM includes contracts generating revenues related mainly to consulting, advisory and
environmental services, intelligent networks and cybersecurity, design and engineering, procurement, project and
construction management, operations and maintenance, and decommissioning. It also includes revenues from
LSTK construction contracts, for which the Company ceased bidding in July 2019, except for certain repetitive
EPC offerings that are lower-risk, standardized solutions.
Engineering Services incorporates consultancy, engineering, design and project management services
around the world, primarily for the building & places, defence, industrial, minerals & metals, power &
renewables, transportation and water markets. A significant portion of Engineering Services revenues are
derived from the public sector, including national, provincial, state and local and municipal authorities. The
Engineering Services segment derives its revenues primarily from reimbursable and engineering services
contracts.
Nuclear supports clients across the entire nuclear lifecycle with the full spectrum of services from
consultancy, EPCM services, field services, technology services, spare parts, reactor support and
decommissioning and waste management. As stewards of the CANDU® technology, it also provides
new-build and full refurbishment services of CANDU® reactors. The Nuclear segment derives its revenues
primarily from reimbursable and engineering services contracts.
O&M consists of providing operations, maintenance and asset management solutions for bridges, transit
systems, highways, buildings and industrial plants including power plants, water supply and treatment
systems and desalination plants, as well as postal services and ships. The O&M segment derives all its
revenues from reimbursable and engineering services contracts.
Linxon offers engineering, procurement, management and construction services for execution of large,
complex alternative current power substations including expansions and electrification, notably through
repetitive EPC offerings in the following markets: Utilities, Renewable, Conventional Generation,
Transportation and Data centers. The Linxon segment derives its revenues mainly from standardized
EPC contracts.
Combined, the four segments described above are presented under the AtkinsRéalis Services
(previously, SNCL Services) line of business.
LSTK Projects is comprised of the remaining LSTK construction contracts of the Company, notably mass
transit projects in Canada and one LSTK project in the Middle East. This segment also includes the
financial results of legacy warranty costs and claims from completed LSTK projects. In July 2019, the
Company decided to cease bidding on new LSTK construction contracts. The LSTK Projects segment
derives all its revenues from LSTK construction contracts.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

While our contracts are negotiated using a variety of contracting options, PS&PM revenues are derived primarily
from three major types of contracts: reimbursable and engineering services contracts, LSTK construction
contracts, and standardized EPC contracts, all of which are defined in Section 5. PS&PM contracts can be found
in the following segments and lines of business:

Nuclear includes one legacy LSTK construction contract.

The Company derives its PS&PM revenues from reimbursable and engineering services contracts (2023: 87%;
2022: 81%), standardized EPC contracts (2023: 7%; 2022: 8%) and LSTK construction contracts (2023: 6%;
2022: 11%).
CAPITAL
Capital is AtkinsRéalis’ investment, financing and asset management arm, responsible for developing projects,
arranging financing, investing equity, undertaking complex financial modeling and managing its infrastructure
investments for optimal returns. Its activities are principally concentrated in infrastructure such as bridges,
highways, mass transit systems, power facilities, energy infrastructure, water treatment plants and social
infrastructure (e.g. hospitals). The Capital segment includes AtkinsRéalis’ 20% ownership interest in and
management of SNC-Lavalin Infrastructure Partners LP.
Capital is involved in public-private partnerships. These arrangements allow for the transfer to the private sector of
many of the risks associated with designing, building, operating, maintaining and financing such assets. In return,
the client will either: i) commit to making regular payments, usually in the form of availability payments, upon the
start of operations of the infrastructure for a defined period of time (typically 20 to 40 years); ii) authorize the
infrastructure concession entity to charge users of the infrastructure for a defined period of time; or iii) a
combination of both.
Revenues from Capital investments are generated mainly from dividends or distributions received by AtkinsRéalis
from the investment concession entities or from all or a portion of an investment concession entity’s revenues or
net results, depending on the accounting method required by IFRS.
It is the Company’s view that the aggregate fair value of its Capital investments is significantly higher than their
net book value of $658.0 million as at December 31, 2023. The Company’s remaining stake of 6.76% in 407
International Inc. (“Highway 407 ETR”) represents the most significant portion of the total fair value of the
Company’s Capital investments portfolio.
As at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the net book value of Capital investments can be summarized as follows:

The net book value is nil as the Company had previously stopped recognizing its share of the losses of Highway 407 ETR when the cumulative losses and dividends resulted in a negative
balance for the Company’s investment in Highway 407 ETR.

ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGY FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS
The Company’s investments are accounted for either at fair value through other comprehensive income, or
through the equity or consolidation methods depending on whether AtkinsRéalis exercises, or not, significant
influence, joint control or control. The revenues included in the Company’s consolidated income statement are
influenced by the consolidation method applied to a Capital investment, as described below:
ACCOUNTING METHODS FOR THE
COMPANY’S INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL
INVESTMENTS

REVENUES INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT

Consolidation

Revenues that are recognized and reported by the Capital investments

Equity method

AtkinsRéalis’ share of net results of the Capital investments or dividends from its Capital
investments for which the carrying amount is nil but would otherwise be negative based on
historical financial results and dividends if AtkinsRéalis had an obligation to fund the investment.
Dividends are recognized when the Company’s right to receive payment has been established

At fair value through other
comprehensive income

Dividends and distributions from the Capital investments

In evaluating the performance of the segment, the relationship between revenues and Segment Adjusted EBIT is
not meaningful, as a significant portion of the investments are accounted for by the equity method, which do not
reflect the line by line items of the individual Capital investment’s financial results.
Under the equity method of accounting, distributions from a joint venture or associate reduce the carrying amount
of the investment. The equity method of accounting requires the Company to stop recognizing its share of the
losses of a joint venture or associate when the recognition of such losses results in a negative balance for its
investment, or where dividends declared by the joint venture or associate are in excess of the carrying amount of
the investment. In these events, the carrying value of the investment is reduced to nil, but does not become
negative, unless the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the
joint venture or associate. In these situations, the Company no longer recognizes its share of net income (loss) of
a Capital investment based on its ownership, but rather recognizes in its net income the amount of dividends
declared by a joint venture or associate that would otherwise result in a negative carrying value of such
investment.
ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON CAPITAL INVESTMENTS
The Company provides additional financial information on its Capital investments to allow the reader to have a
better understanding of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for PS&PM activities and
Capital investments. As such, the following information on the Company’s Capital investments is included in the
2023 Annual Financial Statements:

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2.2

HOW WE BUDGET AND FORECAST OUR RESULTS

The Company prepares a formal annual budget (“Annual Budget”) in the fourth quarter of each year.
SEGMENT LEVEL
The budget information is prepared by the Company’s respective leadership teams at the segment level by
aggregating the anticipated results of specific regions business units and divisions and incorporating costs related
to the operations of the segments, such as its level of selling, general and administrative expenses. Assumptions
used to prepare the segments’ budget would include, among others, existing backlog, known prospects and
anticipated level of activities from existing or new clients, availability of resources to provide services, anticipated
utilization rates of the workforce, costs resulting from anticipated revenues as well as committed or contractual
expenses.
CONSOLIDATED LEVEL
The segment budgets are subsequently reviewed by the Company’s senior executives and compiled to determine
the consolidated budget.
The Annual Budget is a key tool used by management to monitor the Company’s performance and progress
against key financial objectives in accordance with the Company’s strategic plan. The Company updates its
annual expected results in the first, second and third quarters (“Quarterly Forecasts”), which are also presented to
the Board of Directors.
The key elements taken into account when estimating revenues, gross margin and cash flows generated from
(used for) operating activities for budget and forecast purposes from PS&PM activities are the following:
KEY ELEMENTS

IMPACT ON THE ANNUAL BUDGET

Backlog

Firm contracts used to estimate a portion of future revenues taking into account the execution and
expected performance on an individual project basis for certain major projects.

Prospects list

Unsigned contracts that the Company is currently bidding on, future projects on which it intends to
bid and/or overall portfolio of potential work within a given market. Management also considers
sources of revenues such as recurring business from known clients and expected service orders
under master service agreements.

Execution and
expected performance

Revenues and costs (or execution) of projects are determined on an individual project basis for
major projects or by groups of projects or specific markets and take into consideration assumptions
on risks and uncertainties that can have an impact on the progress and/or profitability of that
project. This includes, but is not limited to, performance of the Company’s employees and
subcontractors or equipment suppliers, as well as price and availability of labour, equipment and
materials.

Regarding its Capital budget and forecast, the Company establishes the expected results based on assumptions
specific to each investment.
One of the key management tools for monitoring the Company’s performance is the monthly and quarterly
evaluation and analysis of actual results compared to the Annual Budget or the Quarterly Forecasts, for revenues
and profitability. This enables management to analyze its performance and, if necessary, take remedial actions.
Variations from the Annual Budget or Quarterly Forecasts, as applicable, may arise from a number of reasons,
including the materialization of any of the risk factors disclosed in Section 14 of this MD&A, but usually result
from the following:
SOURCE OF VARIATION

EXPLANATION

Level of activity

Variation depends on the number of newly awarded, ongoing, completed or nearcompleted projects, and on the progress made on each of these projects in the
period. The level of activity can also depend on the availability and productivity of
human resources.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

99

SOURCE OF VARIATION

EXPLANATION

Changes in the estimated costs to
complete each individual project
(“cost reforecasts”)

Variation of the estimated costs to complete projects for contracts having revenue
recognized over time using the percentage of completion method results in either a
positive or negative impact to a project’s results. Increases or decreases in
profitability for any given project are largely dependent on project execution and
other factors, such as availability and productivity of internal and external
resources and actual costs associated to each component of a given project.

Changes in the estimated revenues
and in the recovery of such revenues

Variation of the estimated revenues of projects, including the impact from change
orders, claims, incentives and penalties, as well as the change in estimates on the
recovery of trade receivables and contract assets, may impact the financial results
of the Company.

Changes in the results of Capital
investments

Variation in the financial results of each Capital investment accounted for under the
consolidation or equity methods will impact the financial results of the Company.
Additions to the Company’s Capital investments portfolio, or divestitures from it,
can also impact the Company’s results.

Level of selling, general and
administrative expenses

Variation in selling, general and administrative expenses has a direct impact on the
profitability of the Company. The level of selling, general and administrative
expenses is influenced by the level of activity, and can depend on several other
factors not related to project execution or performance that can be recurring or not.

Acquisition-related costs and
integration costs

Business acquisitions might require the Company to incur significant acquisitionrelated costs and integration costs, which have an impact on actual and future
results.

Restructuring and transformation
costs, and goodwill and other
intangible assets impairment

Changes made to the way the Company operates, closure of certain locations
where it conducts business, modifications to its offerings and changes in market
perspectives might result, among other factors, in restructuring and transformation
costs, and goodwill and other intangible assets impairment, having an impact on
actual and future results.

Income taxes

Variation in income taxes impact the profitability of the Company, and depends on
various factors, such as the geographic areas in which the Company is present,
the statutory tax rates enacted, the nature of the revenues earned by the
Company, the recoverability of deferred tax assets as well as tax assessments
made by authorities.

Financial expense

Variation in interest rates could have an impact on the Company’s results, as some
of its financing bears interest at a variable rate.

Foreign exchange

As the Company operates in many countries, foreign currency exchange rates can
cause variances to estimates as the budgets and forecasts are prepared at
specific rates. It should be noted that the Company has a foreign exchange
hedging policy that limits, to a certain extent, the volatility in results caused by
foreign exchange fluctuations.

Timing of collection and of
disbursements

Variation in the number of days required to invoice and then collect amounts due
from clients, as well as variation in the payment terms from suppliers and
subcontractors can impact the Company’s cash flows generated from (used for)
operating activities.

these financial measures to the most directly comparable measure specified under IFRS, when applicable.

The Company’s financial highlights reflect the following major items:
◦

◦

Revenues in 2023 increased to $8,634.3 million compared to $7,549.0 million in 2022, mainly from higher
revenues from Engineering Services, Nuclear and Capital, partially offset by lower revenues mainly from
LSTK Projects.
Net income from continuing operations totaled $286.6 million in 2023 compared to $7.0 million in 2022. The
main reasons for this increase were:
◦ higher contributions mainly from Engineering Services and Capital combined with a lower loss from
LSTK Projects in 2023 compared to 2022 and a positive contribution from Linxon in 2023 compared
to a loss from this segment in 2022;
◦ a $46.2 million gain on disposal of a PS&PM business in the third quarter of 2023 related to the
disposal of the Company’s Scandinavian Engineering Services business (refer to Section 4.1.3.5);
◦ lower restructuring and transformation costs in 2023 compared to 2022;
◦ a $27.4 million DPCP Remediation Agreement (each such term as hereinafter defined) expense (refer
to Section 4.1.3.6) recognized in 2022;

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The above items were partially offset by:

◦

◦

3.2

◦ higher net financial expenses in 2023 compared to 2022;
◦ an income tax expense in 2023 compared to an income tax recovery in 2022; and
◦ a higher level of corporate selling, general and administrative expenses in 2023 compared to 2022.
A net loss from discontinued operations of $6.9 million in 2022, reflecting an adjustment to the gain on
disposal of the Oil & Gas business resulting from an agreement reached on purchase price adjustments.
Cash and cash equivalents of $473.6 million as at December 31, 2023, compared to $570.3 million as at
December 31, 2022, as the net cash generated from operating and investing activities in 2023 was more than
offset by the net cash used for financing activities for such period.
Revenue backlog of $14.1 billion as at December 31, 2023, higher than the revenue backlog of $12.6 billion
as at December 31, 2022.

NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO ATKINSRÉALIS SHAREHOLDERS FROM CONTINUING
OPERATIONS FROM PS&PM
Net income attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders from continuing operations from PS&PM was $213.0 million
in 2023, compared to a net loss attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders from continuing operations from PS&PM
of $45.0 million in 2022. The increase was mainly due to (i) a higher contribution from Engineering Services, a
lower loss from LSTK Projects and a positive contribution from Linxon in 2023 compared to a loss from this
segment in 2022, (ii) a $46.2 million gain on disposal of a PS&PM business in the third quarter of 2023, (iii) lower
restructuring and transformation costs in 2023, and (iv) a $27.4 million DPCP Remediation Agreement expense
incurred in the second quarter of 2022 while there was no such expense in 2023. This increase was partially
offset mainly by (i) higher net financial expenses in 2023 compared to 2022, (ii) a net income tax expense in 2023
compared to an income tax recovery in 2022, and (iii) higher corporate selling, general and administrative
expenses in 2023 compared to 2022.
NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO ATKINSRÉALIS SHAREHOLDERS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS
FROM CAPITAL
Net income attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders from continuing operations from Capital amounted
to $74.2 million in 2023, compared to $61.6 million in 2022. The increase was mainly due to higher dividends
received from Highway 407 ETR, combined with higher contributions from certain investments in 2023 compared

Partnership (“InPower BC G.P.”) in the first quarter of 2022.
NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests from continuing operations amounted to $0.6 million in
2023, compared to $9.6 million in 2022, both mainly attributable to the allocation of net loss to the non-controlling
interest of Linxon.

4.1.2.3 CONSOLIDATED EBIT, EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ANALYSIS
In 2023, EBIT was $511.2 million, compared to $95.0 million in 2022. The increase in EBIT was primarily due to
(i) a higher contribution from Engineering Services, a lower loss from LSTK Projects and a positive contribution
from Linxon in 2023 compared to a loss from this segment in 2022, (ii) a $46.2 million gain on disposal of a
PS&PM business in the third quarter of 2023, (iii) lower restructuring and transformation costs in 2023 compared
to 2022 and (iv) a $27.4 million DPCP Remediation Agreement expense incurred in 2022, while there was no
such expense in 2023, partially offset mainly by higher corporate selling, general and administrative expenses.
EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure. EBITDA is defined and reconciled to net income from continuing
operations in Section 13.
EBITDA was $759.5 million in 2023, compared to $346.5 million in 2022, with the increase being mainly
explained by the same factors described above for EBIT. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-IFRS measure described in
Section 13.1, amounted to $762.6 million in 2023, compared to $453.0 million in 2022. When excluding the
results from Capital, Adjusted EBITDA from PS&PM, also a non-IFRS measure described in Section 13.1 (within
the definition of Adjusted EBITDA), amounted to $678.2 million in 2023, compared to $387.9 million in 2022.

at fair value through profit or loss totaled $176.2 million in 2023, compared to $124.0 million in 2022. The
increase in 2023 was primarily driven by expenses incurred on the Company’s rebranding and revised estimates
on long-term employee incentives.
The gain arising on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss amounted to $7.7 million in
2023 (2022: a loss of $3.3 million).

Net financial expenses from PS&PM amounted to $177.0 million in 2023, compared to $111.8 million in 2022.
This was mainly due to a higher level of interest expense on the debt in 2023, resulting mainly from a higher debt
level and higher interest rates on variable rate debt combined with net foreign exchange losses in 2023 compared
to net foreign exchange gains in 2022, partially offset by higher financial income in 2023 compared to 2022.
Net financial expenses from Capital increased to $8.6 million in 2023, compared to $4.0 million in 2022,
mainly due to a higher level of interest expense on non-recourse debt.

In 2023, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $39.0 million, compared to an income tax
recovery of $27.8 million in 2022.
In 2023, the effective income tax rate from PS&PM was lower than the Canadian statutory income tax rate
of 26.4%, mainly due to the geographic mix of earnings and the non-taxable gain on the disposal of the
Company’s Scandinavian Engineering Services business, partially offset by non-deductible expenses and other
permanent items.
In 2022, the effective income tax recovery rate from PS&PM was higher than the Canadian statutory income tax
rate of 26.3%, mainly due to revised estimates on certain income tax liabilities and the geographic mix of
earnings, partially offset by the non-tax deductible DPCP Remediation Agreement expense and other permanent
items.
The effective income tax rate from Capital was lower than the Canadian statutory income tax rate of 26.4%
in 2023, mainly due to the non-taxable portion of investment income, including dividends received from Highway

Engineering Services revenues were $5,897.3 million in 2023, compared to $4,686.2 million in 2022, a 25.8%
increase. This increase was driven primarily by strong volume growth year-over-year in the Middle East, the
United Kingdom and the United States as well as an increased volume from Minerals & Metals. Excluding the
effect of foreign currency changes, Engineering Services organic revenue growth (a non-IFRS financial measure
described in Section 13) was 23.9% when compared to 2022. Backlog increased to a record-high level of
$5,430.9 million as at December 31, 2023, compared to $4,662.1 million as at December 31, 2022.
The major revenue contributors in 2023 included projects in the defence and infrastructure areas in the United
Kingdom, major infrastructure projects in buildings & places in the Middle East, and ongoing major projects in
transportation and buildings & places in Canada. Public transportation projects and industrial projects were the
major contributors in the United States.
Segment Adjusted EBIT from Engineering Services increased to $519.6 million (Segment Adjusted
EBITDA of $639.7 million) in 2023, compared to a Segment Adjusted EBIT of $397.7 million (Segment Adjusted
EBITDA of $517.3 million) in 2022. The increase was mainly driven by the higher level of revenue.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA to segment net revenue from Engineering Services ratio was 14.4% in 2023,
compared to 14.6% in 2022. Refer to Section 13.4.6 for the calculation of this ratio.
Segment Adjusted EBIT and Segment Adjusted EBITDA are presented before restructuring costs, which are
disclosed in Section 4.1.3.2, and, in 2023, exclude the $46.2 million gain on the disposal of the Company’s

Nuclear revenues amounted to $1,044.1 million in 2023, compared to $896.0 million in 2022, a 16.5%
increase. This was primarily due to higher volumes from Europe, Asia and the United States, partially offset by
lower volume in Canada resulting mainly from a decreased level of activity on certain major projects. Excluding
the effect of foreign currency changes, Nuclear organic revenue growth (a non-IFRS financial measure described
in Section 13) was 14.3% when compared to 2022. Nuclear backlog increased to $1,854.0 million as at
December 31, 2023 compared to $936.6 million as at December 31, 2022, notably from the addition of life
extension projects.
The major revenue contributors in 2023 were reactor support and life extensions (43%), decommissioning and
waste management (34%) and new builds (23%).
In 2023, the Segment Adjusted EBIT from Nuclear amounted to $145.5 million (Segment Adjusted EBITDA
of $160.2 million), in line with a Segment Adjusted EBIT of $144.0 million for 2022 (Segment Adjusted EBITDA of
$158.1 million), as the increase in activity described above with respect to revenues was offset mainly by higher
operating costs during the year.

Linxon revenues were $577.8 million in 2023, compared to $561.2 million in 2022, a 3.0% increase mainly due
to an increase in the level of activity primarily due to projects in the Middle East and Europe, partially offset by a
lower level of activity due to the projects in the United States and Asia Pacific nearing completion. Excluding the
effect of foreign currency changes, Linxon organic revenue growth (a non-IFRS financial measure described in
Section 13) was 0.9% when compared to 2022. Linxon backlog increased to $1,439.2 million as at
December 31, 2023 compared to $881.8 million as at December 31, 2022, mainly from new projects in the United
States, the Middle East and Asia Pacific.
The major revenue contributors in 2023 included projects in the Middle East, Europe and the United States.
In 2023, Segment Adjusted EBIT from Linxon was $0.9 million (Segment Adjusted EBITDA $4.9 million),
compared to a negative Segment Adjusted EBIT of $9.8 million (Segment Adjusted EBITDA of negative
$5.7 million) in 2022. The Segment Adjusted EBIT in 2022 reflected project delays and higher costs on European
projects. To a lesser extent, similar unfavourable reforecasts also occurred in 2023 in the Asia Pacific region and
from a major project nearing completion in the United States.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA to segment net revenue from Linxon ratio was 1.1% in 2023, compared to
negative 1.3% in 2022, mainly due to the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 for the same reasons
described for Segment Adjusted EBIT above. Refer to Section 13.4.6 for the calculation of this ratio.

LSTK Projects revenues were $506.7 million in 2023, compared to $799.3 million in 2022, as the LSTK
Projects backlog continued to reduce as part of the Company’s strategy to exit this segment of business.
The major revenue contributors in 2023 included projects for mass transit systems infrastructure projects in
Central and Eastern Canada.
The Segment Adjusted EBIT from LSTK Projects was negative $58.6 million (negative Segment Adjusted

Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $238.8 million) in 2022.
The negative Segment Adjusted EBIT in 2023 was mainly due to segment overhead costs from the ongoing
efforts to bring the remaining projects to completion. The negative Segment Adjusted EBIT in 2022 was mainly
due to unfavourable cost reforecasts on certain major projects.

Backlog is defined as a forward-looking indicator of anticipated revenues to be recognized by the Company,
determined based on contract awards that are firm and amounting to the transaction price allocated to remaining
performance obligations. Management may be required to make estimates regarding the revenue to be generated
from certain contracts.
Revenue backlog is derived primarily from three major types of contracts: reimbursable and engineering
services contracts, standardized EPC contracts and LSTK construction contracts.
◦

Reimbursable and engineering services contracts: Reimbursable and engineering services contracts
include all revenue-generating contracts of the Company, except standardized EPC contracts and LSTK
construction contracts described below. Under reimbursable contracts, the Company charges the customer
for the actual cost incurred plus a mark-up that could take various forms, such as a fixed-fee per unit, a
percentage of costs incurred or an incentive fee based on achieving certain targets, performance factors or
contractual milestones. Reimbursable contracts also include unit-rate contracts for which a fixed amount per
quantity is charged to the customer, and reimbursable contracts with a cap or a target price accompanied by
incentives and/or disincentives. Engineering services contracts include time and material agreements based
on hourly rates and fixed-price lump-sum contracts with limited procurement or construction risks.
Reimbursable and engineering services contracts also include all O&M contracts, most of which are fixedprice agreements subject to price-adjustment clauses such as inflation-driven indexation.

◦

Standardized EPC contracts: Under standardized EPC contracts, the Company provides repetitive EPC
offerings that are lower-risk, standardized solutions for: i) district cooling plants; and ii) power substations
executed through its Linxon subsidiary.

◦

LSTK construction contracts: Under LSTK construction contracts, the Company completes the work
required for the project at a lump-sum price. Before entering into such contracts, the Company estimates the
total cost of the project, plus a profit margin. The Company’s actual profit margin may vary based on its ability
to achieve the project requirements at, above or below the initial estimated costs. Although these projects are
at a lump-sum price, the amount of associated revenue could nevertheless vary based on change orders,
claims or other contract modifications, negotiated or otherwise awarded, which might take various forms.
Projects in this category were all initiated as lump-sum contracts, and while in some cases have been
modified to change their lump-sum risk exposure, continue to be presented in this category.

Backlog from Capital represents the amount that will be recognized as revenue from contracts with customers in the Capital segment from a concession.

The Company’s revenue backlog increased to $14.1 billion as at December 31, 2023, compared to
$12.6 billion as at December 31, 2022, due to an increase in Nuclear, Engineering Services and Linxon, partially
offset mainly by a decrease in O&M and LSTK Projects.
BACKLOG RECONCILIATION
In the following section, the Company presents its “booking-to-revenue ratio”, a non-IFRS measure, which
corresponds to contract bookings divided by revenues for a given period. This measure provides a basis for
assessing the renewal of business. However, the revenue backlog measure does not include prospects, one of
the key elements taken into account when estimating revenues and gross margin for budget and forecast
purposes described in Section 2.2, which can be a significant portion of the budgeted and/or forecasted revenues.

◦

Revenues totaled $2,279.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $1,900.1 million in the
corresponding quarter of 2022, mainly reflecting an increase in Engineering Services, Nuclear, Linxon and
Capital, partially offset by a decrease mainly in LSTK Projects.

◦

For the fourth quarter of 2023, net income attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders was $90.0 million
($0.51 per diluted share), compared to a net loss attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders of $54.4 million
($0.31 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting primarily:
◦

higher contributions mainly from Engineering Services and Capital, combined with lower losses from
LSTK Projects and Linxon in the fourth quarter of 2023;

◦

lower restructuring and transformation costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth
quarter of 2022;

which were partially offset by:

◦

118

◦

an income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to an income tax recovery in the
corresponding period in 2022; and

◦

a higher level of corporate selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023
compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.

For the fourth quarter of 2023, adjusted net income attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders from
PS&PM was $79.5 million ($0.45 per diluted share), compared to an adjusted net loss attributable to
AtkinsRéalis shareholders from PS&PM of $32.5 million ($0.19 per diluted share) for the comparable quarter
in 2022, for the same reasons stated above, except for the change in restructuring and transformation costs,
which is excluded from this non-IFRS measure.

◦

As at December 31, 2023, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to $473.6 million,
compared to $563.5 million as at September 30, 2023. The decrease is mainly attributable to net cash used
for financing activities of $337.8 million and for investing activities of $25.2 million, partially offset by net cash
generated from operating activities of $272.8 million, in each case, in the fourth quarter of 2023.

◦

From a business line perspective, AtkinsRéalis Services generated $456.2 million of net cash from operating
activities in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $339.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, while LSTK
Projects used $120.6 million of net cash for operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to
$56.4 million used in the fourth quarter of 2022. The remaining balance of cash flows used for operating
activities relates to Capital, corporate activities and items not allocated to the Company’s segments. Net cash
generated from (used for) operating activities on a line of business/segment basis is a supplementary
financial measure. An explanation of the composition of this supplementary financial measure is provided in
Section 13.2.

◦

Revenue backlog was $14.1 billion as at December 31, 2023, compared to $12.8 billion as at
September 30, 2023, mainly reflecting an increase in Nuclear, Engineering Services, Linxon and LSTK
Projects, partially offset by a decrease in O&M.

Total Segment Adjusted EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $232.2 million, compared to a total Segment
Adjusted EBIT of $50.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase is largely attributable to higher
contributions mainly from Engineering Services and Capital, combined with lower losses from LSTK Projects and
Linxon.
The higher contribution from Engineering Services was mainly driven by a higher level of revenue in the fourth
quarter of 2023.
Segment Adjusted EBIT from Nuclear amounted to $41.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, in line with the
fourth quarter of 2022, as the increase resulting mainly from higher contributions from Europe and Asia was offset
mainly by lower contributions from the United States resulting from lower volumes.
The lower negative Segment Adjusted EBIT from Linxon in the fourth quarter of 2023 resulted mainly from an
increased level of activity compared to the corresponding quarter of 2022 and unfavourable reforecasts on certain
projects that negatively impacted this segment in the fourth quarter of 2022.
The negative Segment Adjusted EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2023 from LSTK Projects was mainly attributable to
segment overhead costs from the ongoing efforts to bring the remaining projects to completion, while the negative
Segment Adjusted EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2022 was mainly due to unfavourable cost reforecasts on certain
major projects which were affected by higher construction and materials costs, inflation rates, supply chain
disruptions and labour actions.
The higher contribution from Capital mainly reflected higher dividends received from Highway 407 ETR in the
fourth quarter of 2023 and higher contributions from certain other investments.

120

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses not allocated to segments amounted to
$42.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $31.3 million in the corresponding period of 2022. The
variance is mainly due to expenses incurred in connection with the Company’s rebranding and revised estimates
on long-term employee incentives in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Restructuring and transformation costs amounted to $21.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared
to $53.9 million in the corresponding period of 2022. These costs were mainly related to restructuring activities in
the Engineering Services segment in the fourth quarter of 2023, while they were mainly due to non-cash charges
incurred to right size the office real estate footprint to align with new working practices in the fourth quarter of
2022.
Net financial expenses amounted to $45.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $46.9 million in
the corresponding period of 2022, as lower foreign exchange losses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were partially
offset by a higher level of interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting mainly higher debt levels and
higher interest rates experienced during the year.
The income tax expense of $13.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, was mainly a result of the profit for the
period. The effective income tax rate was lower than the Canadian statutory income tax rate mainly due to net
income not affected by tax, geographic mix of earnings and other permanent items.
The income tax recovery of $38.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 was mainly a result of the loss for the
period. The effective income tax recovery rate was higher than the Canadian statutory income tax rate mainly due
to revised estimates on certain income tax liabilities and net income not affected by tax, partially offset by the
geographic mix of earnings and other permanent items.

Net cash generated from operating activities before net change in non-cash working capital items
totaled $252.8 million in 2023, compared to $15.2 million in 2022.

◦

As detailed in Note 27C to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements, net change in non-cash working capital
items used net cash of $186.9 million in 2023, compared to net cash used of $260.6 million in 2022. This
difference reflected a favourable variance mainly in deferred revenues, trade payables and accrued liabilities,
other current non-financial liabilities and other current non-financial assets, partially offset by an unfavourable
variance in contract assets and trade receivables.

◦

From a business line perspective, AtkinsRéalis Services generated $803.8 million of net cash from operating
activities in 2023 compared to $552.2 million generated in 2022, while LSTK Projects used $410.9 million of
net cash for operating activities in 2023 compared to $425.0 million used in 2022. The remaining balance of
net cash used for operating activities relates to Capital, corporate activities and items not allocated to the
Company’s segments. Net cash generated from (used for) operating activities on a line of business/segment
basis is a supplementary financial measure. An explanation of the composition of this supplementary financial
measure is provided in Section 13.2.

In 2023, payments for Capital investments amounted to nil, compared to $39.6 million in 2022. The
payments made in 2022 included contributions made by the Company to Carlyle Global Infrastructure
Opportunity Fund, L.P. (“Carlyle”) prior to the sale by the Company of its ownership interest in such fund in the
fourth quarter of 2022.

◦

The net cash inflow from disposal of a Capital investment accounted for by the consolidation method of
$40.5 million in 2022 related to the disposal of InPower BC G.P. during the same year.

◦

The variance in net cash inflow (cash outflow) on disposals of PS&PM businesses related primarily to
proceeds from the disposal of the Company’s Scandinavian Engineering Services business received in 2023
(refer to Note 6A to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements).

◦

In 2023, the Company collected the remaining balance of the consideration receivable for the disposal in

comprehensive income until its disposal. This consideration received was US$25.5 million (approximately
CA$34.3 million), compared to a consideration received of US$21.5 million (approximately CA$29.5 million)
in 2022 (refer to Note 5A to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements).

8.2

CAPITAL STRUCTURE MANAGEMENT

The Company’s sources of funds stem primarily from its operating cash flows from PS&PM projects and Capital
investments, the divestiture of matured Capital investments and non-core assets, the issuance of debt and
additional financial capacity available under the 2022 Credit Agreement. The Company’s funds are mainly used to
meet working capital requirements and sustain capital expenditures on projects, make equity investments, pay
dividends to shareholders and for mergers and acquisitions activities.
AtkinsRéalis’ key objectives for its capital allocation framework are:
◦

To drive organic and inorganic PS&PM growth;

◦

Optimize its balance sheet; and

◦

Return capital to shareholders.

As at December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $473.6 million, compared to
$570.3 million as at December 31, 2022.
Furthermore, as at December 31, 2023, the Company had a committed Revolving Credit Facility of
$1,800.0 million under its Revolving Credit Facility (December 31, 2022: $2,000.0 million), of which $1,285.3
million was unused (December 31, 2022: $1,633.3 million), and uncommitted credit facilities by way of bilateral
letters of credit.
While liquidity remains subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and limitations, including but not limited to the
risks described in Section 14 of this MD&A and in this Section, the Company believes that its current liquidity
position, including its cash position, unused credit capacity and cash generated from its operations, should be
sufficient to fund its operations over the foreseeable future. See also Section 14, “Risks and Uncertainties” of this
MD&A, for a more specific overview of the risks and uncertainties relating to the Company.
In addition, due to the nature of the Company’s activities and the fact that its operations are conducted through
multiple entities and joint arrangements on an international level, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are
distributed across numerous locations. In order to manage its cash needs and reserves, the Company is part of
various cash pooling agreements with financial institutions and may transfer cash balances between subsidiaries
and joint arrangements, and use credit facilities to meet the capital requirements of certain projects or other cash
disbursements.

8.4

DEBT AND FINANCING AGREEMENTS

FINANCIAL COVENANTS
The Company was required to maintain, as at December 31, 2023, a ratio of net recourse debt to EBITDA (as
defined under the relevant agreements) not to exceed: (a) 3.75x under the Company’s 2022 Credit Agreement;
and (b) 3.50x under the loan agreement, dated as of April 20, 2017, between AtkinsRéalis Highway Holding Inc.
("Highway Holding") (previously, SNC-Lavalin Highway Holdings Inc.), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, and CDPQ RF, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (as amended,
restated or otherwise modified, from time to time, the “CDPQ Loan Agreement” and the limited recourse loan
established thereunder, the “CDPQ Loan”). The Company was in compliance with these covenants as at
December 31, 2023.

126

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The terms “net recourse debt” and “EBITDA” are defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement and in the CDPQ Loan
Agreement and do not correspond to the similarly labelled financial measures used in this MD&A. Furthermore,
the covenant ratio is calculated using certain financial information not disclosed in the 2023 Annual Financial
Statements or in this MD&A, or not considered recourse debt in such documents.
REPAYMENT OF SERIES 4 DEBENTURES
In the first quarter of 2023, the Company repaid in full at maturity the Series 4 Debentures for an aggregate
principal amount of $200.0 million.
HEDGING OF A PORTION OF THE TERM LOAN
In 2023 and 2022, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions related to its
$500 million Term Loan. Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Company pays interest at a fixed rate and
receives interest at a variable rate on a total notional amount of $375 million. The interest rate swap agreements
will expire in April 2025 and are subject to hedge accounting as being part of cash flow hedges.
AMENDMENTS TO THE 2022 CREDIT AGREEMENT
In the second quarter of 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with its lenders to extend the maturity of
its 2022 Credit Agreement from May 13, 2025 to May 31, 2026. As a result of this agreement, the notional amount
of Tranche A of the Revolving Credit Facility is $1,350.0 million until May 13, 2025 and $1,315.1 million thereafter
and until May 31, 2026, the notional amount of Tranche B of the Revolving Credit Facility is $450.0 million until
May 13, 2025 and $438.4 million thereafter and until May 31, 2026, and the notional amount of the Term Loan
remains at $500.0 million until May 31, 2026.
AMENDMENTS TO THE CDPQ LOAN
In the third quarter of 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with CDPQ RF mainly to extend the maturity
of its CDPQ Loan from July 2024 to July 2026. The notional amount of the CDPQ Loan remains at $400.0 million
until July 2026.
AMENDMENT TO THE UNSECURED LOAN OF LINXON
In the third quarter of 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with the holder of the non-controlling interest
of 49% in Linxon to extend the maturity of the interest-free loan in the principal amount of US$9.3 million
(approximately CA$12.5 million) from September 1, 2023 to September 1, 2024.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT INDICATORS

The Company periodically monitors capital using certain ratios, which are described further below.
NET LIMITED RECOURSE AND RECOURSE DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA RATIO
Net limited recourse and recourse debt to Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS ratio used to analyze the Company’s
financial leverage. Such ratio does not correspond to the financial covenant ratio discussed in Section 8.4. It is
calculated by comparing the net limited recourse and recourse debt at the end of a given period with Adjusted
EBITDA of the corresponding trailing twelve-month period, as follows:

While the level of limited recourse debt as at December 31, 2023 remained in line with its level as at
December 31, 2022, the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and recourse debt in 2023 resulted in a higher
level of net limited recourse and recourse debt as at December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022.
However, when considering the higher level of Adjusted EBITDA for the 12-month period ended
December 31, 2023 compared to the 12-month period ended December 31, 2022, the net limited recourse and
recourse debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 1.8 as at December 31, 2023, from 2.9 as at
December 31, 2022.
RETURN ON AVERAGE SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (“ROASE”)
ROASE is a supplementary financial measure. A definition of this supplementary financial measure is provided
in Section 13. ROASE was 8.7% in 2023, compared to 0.3% in 2022.

8.6

CREDIT RATINGS

On April 12, 2023, S&P affirmed the Company’s credit rating at BB+ and revised its outlook from stable to
negative. Issue-level ratings have also been affirmed at BB+.
On April 17, 2023, DBRS Limited affirmed the Company’s rating at BB (high) with stable trends. Issue-level ratings

Additional details of the future principal repayments of the Company’s recourse and non-recourse short-term debt
and long-term debt are provided in Note 19 to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements. The commitments to invest
in Capital investments result from AtkinsRéalis not being required to make its contribution immediately when
investing, but instead contributing over time, as detailed in Note 5C to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements. As
at December 31, 2023, the commitments to invest in Capital investments were related to contributions for Eglinton
Crosstown (2022: Eglinton Crosstown) and were presented in “Other current financial liabilities” (see Note 17 to
the 2023 Annual Financial Statements) since they are either expected to be paid in the following year or are
callable on demand. Information regarding the Company’s lease liabilities can be obtained in Note 33 to the 2023
Annual Financial Statements.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company discloses information on the classification and fair value of its financial instruments, as well as on
the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments, and related risk management in Note 29 to the
2023 Annual Financial Statements.
Derivative financial instruments

AtkinsRéalis enters or may enter into derivative financial instruments, namely:
◦

Forward currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

◦

Interest-rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest rates relating to financing arrangements;

◦

Derivative financial instruments to limit its exposure to the variability of the fair value of the share units awarded as
part of share unit plans, which fluctuates according to the Company’s share price; and

◦

Commodity swap agreements for certain contracts to hedge the variability of commodity prices.

Refer to Note 29 to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements for further details.
All financial instruments are entered into with sound financial institutions, which AtkinsRéalis anticipates will satisfy their
obligations under the contracts.

The derivative financial instruments are subject to normal credit terms and conditions, financial controls and
management and risk monitoring procedures.

Critical Accounting Judgements and Key
Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to the 2023 Annual
Financial Statements, management is required to make judgements, estimates, and assumptions about the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and
underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period
of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical accounting judgements and key estimates concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation
uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year are described in detail in Note 3 to the 2023 Annual
Financial Statements.

Accounting Policies and Changes
Please refer to Note 2 to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements for more information regarding the Company’s
disclosure on material accounting policies and changes.
Effective October 1, 2023, the Company modified the presentation of its statement of financial position by
combining the following line items: i) “Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt – Recourse” and
“Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt – Non-recourse” into the line item “Short-term debt and
current portion of long-term debt” (refer to Notes 19 and 27 to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements); ii) “Longterm debt – Recourse”, “Long-term debt – Limited recourse” and “Long-term debt – Non-recourse” into the line
item “Long-term debt” (refer to Notes 19 and 27 to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements); and iii) “Inventories”
and “Other current non-financial assets” into the line item “Other current non-financial assets” (refer to Note 11 to
the 2023 Annual Financial Statements).
These changes were made to simplify the presentation of the Company’s statement of financial position with
information related to these line items now being presented in the notes to financial statements.
This change in presentation was made in accordance with IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
Estimates and Errors, resulting in the restatement of prior year figures.
In certain sections of this MD&A, financial information is provided as at December 31, 2021 or for the periods
ended on or before that date and might differ from information originally presented in the Company’s 2021 annual
MD&A due to the following change applied in 2022:
Effective January 1, 2022, the Company modified the presentation of its income statement by combining the line
items “Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses” and “Loss (gain) arising on financial instruments at
fair value through profit or loss” into the line item “Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses”.
The change described above was made in accordance with IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
Estimates and Errors, resulting in the restatement of the comparative figures of the year ended
December 31, 2021.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Non-IFRS Financial Measures and
Ratios,
Supplementary
Financial
Measures and Non-Financial Information
The following section provides information regarding non-IFRS financial measures and ratios, supplementary
financial measures and non-financial information used by the Company to analyze and evaluate its results. These
measures do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar
measures presented by other issuers. Management believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared
in accordance with IFRS, these measures provide additional insight into the Company’s operating performance
and financial position and certain investors may use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance from
period to period. However, these measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Furthermore, certain non-IFRS
financial measures and ratios, supplementary financial measures and other non-financial information are
presented separately for PS&PM, by excluding components related to Capital, as the Company believes that such
measures are useful as these PS&PM activities are usually analyzed separately by the Company.

13.1

PERFORMANCE

Adjusted diluted earnings per share (“Adjusted diluted EPS”) is defined as adjusted net income (loss)
attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders from continuing operations, divided by the diluted weighted average
number of outstanding shares for the period. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-IFRS ratio that is an indicator of the
financial performance of the Company’s activities and allows the Company to present adjusted net income (loss)
attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders on a diluted share basis. Refer to Section 13.4.1 for a reconciliation of
Adjusted diluted EPS to diluted EPS (namely, net income (loss) per diluted share) as determined under IFRS.
Such reconciliation is provided on a consolidated basis and also separately for PS&PM activities and for Capital,
as the Company believes that such measures are useful since these activities are usually analyzed separately by
the Company.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure used by management to facilitate comparisons of operating
performance from period to period and to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts. Adjusted EBITDA is
based on EBITDA from continuing operations and excludes, when applicable to any given period, charges related
to restructuring and transformation costs, gains (losses) on disposals of PS&PM businesses and Capital
investments (or adjustments to gains or losses on such disposals) and the DPCP Remediation Agreement
expense. It should be noted that the reversal of impairment loss (impairment loss) on remeasurement of assets of
disposal group classified as held for sale to fair value less cost to sell was removed from the list of adjustments
disclosed in prior periods as there was no adjustment of this nature in the current and prior year periods. The
Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful for providing securities analysts, investors and others with
additional information to assist them in understanding components of its financial results, including a more
complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA
is believed to supplement information provided, as it highlights trends that may not otherwise be apparent when
relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Refer to Section 13.4.2 for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net
income (loss) from continuing operations as determined under IFRS. Such reconciliation is provided on a
consolidated basis and also separately for PS&PM activities and for Capital (all adjustments listed above apply to
PS&PM activities, except for the gains (losses) on disposals of Capital investments (or adjustments to gains or
losses on such disposals), which only apply to Capital), as the Company believes that such measures are useful
since these activities are analyzed separately by the Company.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

135

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders is a non-IFRS financial measure and is
defined as net income (loss) attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders from continuing operations, adjusted for
certain specific items that are significant but are not, based on management’s judgement, reflective of the
Company’s underlying operations. These adjustments are, when applicable to any given period, restructuring and
transformation costs, amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations, gains (losses) on
disposals of PS&PM businesses and Capital investments (or adjustments to gains or losses on such disposals)
and the DPCP Remediation Agreement expense, as well as income taxes and non-controlling interests on these
adjustments. It should be noted that the reversal of impairment loss (impairment loss) on remeasurement of
assets of disposal group classified as held for sale to fair value less cost to sell was removed from the list of
adjustments disclosed in prior periods as there was no adjustment of this nature in the current and prior year
periods. The Company believes that Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders is useful
for providing securities analysts, investors and others with additional information to assist them in understanding
components of its financial results, including a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the
Company’s operating performance. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders is
believed to supplement information provided, as it highlights trends that may not otherwise be apparent when
relying solely on IFRS financial measures. It is also used by management to evaluate the performance of the
activities of the Company from period to period. Refer to Section 13.4.1 for a reconciliation of Adjusted net
income (loss) attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders to net income (loss) attributable to AtkinsRéalis
shareholders from continuing operations as determined under IFRS. Such reconciliation is provided on a
consolidated basis and also separately for PS&PM activities and for Capital (all adjustments listed above apply to
PS&PM activities, except gains (losses) on disposals of Capital investments (or adjustments to gains or losses on
such disposals), which only apply to Capital), as the Company believes that such measures are useful since these
activities are analyzed separately by the Company.
Booking-to-revenue ratio is a non-IFRS ratio that corresponds to contract bookings divided by revenues for a
given period. This measure provides a useful basis for assessing the renewal of business, as it compares the
value of performance obligations added in a given period to the amount of revenue recognized upon satisfying
performance obligations in the same period. It should be noted that the amount of revenue used to calculate this
ratio includes only revenues that are under the scope of IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers,
(“IFRS 15”) and are disclosed in Note 9 to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements. Refer to Section 13.4.3 for the
calculation of the booking-to-revenue ratio for selected segments in respect of which the Company believes to be
the most meaningful.
EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure and is defined as earnings from continuing operations before net
financial expenses (income), income taxes, depreciation and amortization. As such, this financial measure allows
comparability of operating results from one period to another by excluding the effects of items that are usually
associated with investing and financing activities. Refer to Section 13.4.2 for a reconciliation of EBITDA to net
income (loss) from continuing operations as determined under IFRS.
Return on Average Shareholders’ Equity (“ROASE”) is a supplementary financial measure and corresponds to
the trailing 12-month net income (loss) attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders, divided by a trailing 13-month
average equity attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders, excluding “other components of equity”. The Company
excludes “other components of equity” because this element of equity results in part from the translation into
Canadian dollars of its foreign operations having a different functional currency, and from the accounting
treatment of cash flow hedges, including its accumulated share of other comprehensive income (loss) of
investments accounted for by the equity method. These amounts are not representative of the way the Company
evaluates the management of its foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. The Company believes that this
financial measure is useful to compare its profitability to a measure of equity that excludes certain elements prone
to volatility. Refer to Section 8.5.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure derived from Segment Adjusted EBIT (defined in
Note 4 to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements) and is used by management to evaluate the performance of the
Company’s segments but excluding certain items related to investing activities, through the exclusion of
depreciation and amortization from direct costs of activities. Management believes that this measure is used by
certain securities analysts and investors when comparing the Company’s performance to that of its peers. See a
reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Segment Adjusted EBIT and consolidated EBIT in Section 13.4.4.

136

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Segment Adjusted EBITDA to segment net revenue ratio for the Engineering Services and Linxon
segments is a non-IFRS ratio used to analyze the profitability of certain of the Company’s segments, and
management believes that it facilitates period-to-period comparisons, as well as comparison with peers. This ratio
is calculated by dividing the amount of Segment Adjusted EBITDA of a given period by the amount of segment net
revenue for the same period. Refer to Section 13.4.6 for the calculation of this ratio.
Segment net revenue is a non-IFRS financial measure that consists of 1) segment revenue less direct costs for
sub-contractors and other direct expenses that are recoverable directly from clients for Engineering Services and
2) segment revenue less costs of equipment provided by the minority shareholder of Linxon. Management
believes that this measure is used by certain securities analysts and investors when comparing the Company’s
performance against competitors and peer companies. Refer to Section 13.4.6 for a quantitative reconciliation of
this measure to segment revenue.

13.2

LIQUIDITY

Days Sales Outstanding (“DSO”) for the Engineering Services segment is a supplementary financial
measure that corresponds to the average number of days needed to convert the trade receivables and contract
assets of the Engineering Services segment into cash, all using a 12-month average balance; the result is then
divided by the 12-month average revenue of the segment and multiplied by 365 days, in order to calculate a
number of days. The Company tracks this metric closely to ensure timely collection and healthy liquidity from the
Engineering Services segment. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors as it demonstrates this
segment’s ability to timely convert its earned revenue into cash. See the DSO for the Engineering Services
segment in Section 4.1.4.1.
Free cash flow (usage) is a non-IFRS financial measure and is defined as net cash generated from (used for)
operating activities less acquisition of property and equipment, and payment of lease liabilities while adding back
the federal charges settlement (PPSC) and the DPCP Remediation Agreement payments included in operating
activities. AtkinsRéalis believes that free cash flow (usage) provides a meaningful measure of discretionary cash
generated (used) by and available to the Company to service debt, meet other payment obligations and make
strategic investments, among other things. This non-IFRS measure excludes the impact of the federal charges
settlement (PPSC) (refer to Note 17 to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements and to Section 14 of this MD&A)
and the DPCP Remediation Agreement expense (refer to Note 32 to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements)
included in operating activities as the Company believes that such elements are not representative of its capacity
to generate cash flow from its ongoing operations. Refer to Section 8.1 for a reconciliation of free cash flow
(usage) to net cash generated from (used for) operating activities.
Free cash flow (usage) to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to AtkinsRéalis shareholders ratio is a
non-IFRS ratio calculated by dividing free cash flow (usage) by adjusted net income (loss) attributable to
AtkinsRéalis shareholders, both non-IFRS measures. The Company believes that such ratio is useful when
analyzing the ability of the Company to convert its profitability into cash. Refer to Section 13.4.7 for the
calculation of this ratio.
Net cash generated from (used for) operating activities on a line of business/segment basis is a
supplementary financial measure and is identical in composition to net cash generated from (used for) operating
activities as reported in the financial statements, except that it is provided on a line of business/segment basis as
opposed to on a consolidated basis. As described elsewhere in this MD&A, the AtkinsRéalis Services line of
business is comprised of the Engineering Services, Nuclear, O&M and Linxon segments. The Company believes
that it is useful to investors to provide this supplementary financial measure on a business line/segment basis due
to the importance of the AtkinsRéalis Services line of business to the Company and that it is also relevant and
useful for investors to be presented this measure for the Company’s core engineering services without including
items from either LSTK Projects, Capital, corporate activities and discontinued operations, as well as items not
allocated to the Company’s segments. The Company also believes that it is relevant and useful to disclose this
supplementary financial measure for LSTK Projects as the Company is completing the projects in this segment.
These measures are presented in Section 8.1.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

137

Net limited recourse and recourse debt is a non-IFRS financial measure corresponding to the total amount of
limited recourse and recourse debt, minus the amount of cash and cash equivalents at the end of a given period.
This measure is used by management to analyze the indebtedness of the Company, excluding lease liabilities as
well as indebtedness related to non-recourse financing. Refer to Section 8.5 for a calculation of this non-IFRS
measure.
Net limited recourse and recourse debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is a non-IFRS ratio used to analyze the
Company’s financial leverage. It is calculated by comparing the Net limited recourse and recourse debt at the end
of a given period with Adjusted EBITDA of the corresponding trailing twelve-month period. Management believes
that this measure is useful in evaluating the Company’s ability to service its limited recourse and recourse debt
from its continuing operations. Refer to Section 8.5 for a calculation of this non-IFRS ratio.
Working capital corresponds to the amount of the Company’s total current assets minus its total current liabilities
and the Current ratio corresponds to the Company’s total current assets divided by its total current liabilities. This
measure and ratio are supplementary financial measures used to compare the Company’s current assets with its
current liabilities and are believed to be useful metrics in analyzing the Company’s liquidity. These measures are
presented in Section 9.1.

13.3

OTHER

Organic revenue is a non-IFRS financial measure corresponding to the amount of revenue of a given period,
excluding the effect of acquisitions, disposals and foreign currency changes of the same period. This non-IFRS
measure is used to analyze the level of activity of the Company excluding the effect of certain transactions and
the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons, as well as
comparison with peers. As such, organic revenue growth (contraction) is a non-IFRS ratio calculated by
comparing the amount of organic revenue of a given period with the amount of organic revenue of the
comparative period. Both organic revenue and organic revenue growth (contraction) do not have a standardized
definition within IFRS and other issuers may define these measures differently and, accordingly, these measures
may not be comparable to similar measures used by other issuers. Refer to Section 13.4.5 for calculations of the
organic revenue growth (contraction) ratio.

Risks and Uncertainties
14.1

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

The Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties in carrying out its activities. The Company has
measures in place to identify, monitor and, to a certain extent, mitigate such risks and uncertainties. Such
measures include, among others, the enterprise risk management program, the work performed by various
committees at the Board of Directors and management levels, as well as the enforcement of numerous policies
and procedures. Investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before investing
in the Company’s securities. Additional risks and/or uncertainties not currently known or that the Company
currently believes are immaterial may also impair its future business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of
operations.
RISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS
Fixed-price contracts or the Company’s failure to meet contractual schedule, performance requirements
or to execute projects efficiently
While the Company has nearly completed exiting LSTK construction contracting, its results of operations and
operating cash flows will remain to a certain extent dependent on the financial results of fixed-price contracts until
the wind-down of the remaining LSTK construction projects is completed and related claims are resolved.
Furthermore, the Company bears the risk for cost overruns from fixed-price contracts other than LSTK
construction projects. Contract revenues and costs are established, in part, based on estimates, which are subject
to a number of assumptions, such as those regarding future economic conditions, productivity, performance of the
Company’s employees and of subcontractors or equipment suppliers, price, inflation, availability of labour,
equipment and materials and other requirements that may affect project costs or schedule, such as obtaining the
required environmental permits and approvals on a timely basis. Cost overruns may also occur when unforeseen
circumstances arise. In addition, reimbursable contracts such as unit-rate contracts for which a fixed amount per
quantity is charged to the customer, and reimbursable contracts with a cap bear some risks that are similar to
those related to fixed-price contracts, as the estimates used to establish the contract unit-rate and/or the
contractual cap are also subject to the assumptions listed above. Also, a significant portion of our services
business derives revenues from multi-year contracts, where there are caps on cost escalations based on initially
agreed-upon pricing indices, and, in a period of time in which the rate of inflation and cost increases exceed the
contractually agreed upon cost escalation index, there is a risk that the margins on revenues derived from such
contracts would be eroded.
Furthermore, should the Company experience difficulties in the execution of projects due to various factors, such
as a lack of efficiency in the implementation of its processes, various impacts on productivity, increases in inflation
and supply chain disruptions, all of which could lead to higher costs and delays to project completions, failure to
accurately estimate project costs and/or conclude strategic transactions pertaining to project resources, such
difficulties could have an adverse impact, whether temporary or permanent, on the Company’s financial results
from these projects, even if the Company is entitled and ultimately able to recover additional compensation for
increased costs and/or obtain an extension of time to complete work on such projects.
Should cost overruns occur, and the Company is unable to recover such overruns from a third party, the Company
will experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a project loss. Significant cost overruns can occur on both large
and smaller contracts or projects. Should a large cost overrun occur, or if cost overruns occur on multiple projects,
such cost overruns could increase the unpredictability and volatility of the Company’s profitability as well as have
a material adverse impact on its business.

156

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

In addition, in certain instances, the Company may guarantee a client that it will complete a project by a
scheduled date or that a facility will achieve certain performance standards or the Company may bear liability in
relation to a project without any contractual cap other than as provided by applicable law. As such, the Company
may incur additional costs should the project or facility subsequently fail to meet the scheduled completion date or
performance standards or if the Company fails or is alleged to have failed to meet its required standard of care. A
project’s revenues could also be reduced in the event the Company is required to pay liquidated damages or in
connection with contractual penalty provisions, which can be substantial and can accrue on a daily basis.
Backlog and contracts with termination for convenience provisions
The Company’s backlog (also referred to as remaining performance obligations) are derived from contract awards
that are considered firm, or management’s estimates of revenues to be generated from firm contract awards for
reimbursable contracts, and is thus an indication of expected future revenues. Project delays, suspensions,
terminations, cancellations or reductions in scope do occur from time to time in the Company’s industry, due to
considerations beyond the control of the Company and may have a material impact on the amount of reported
backlog with a corresponding adverse impact on future revenues and profitability. In addition, a number of project
contracts have warranty periods and/or outstanding claims, which may result in legal proceedings extending for
considerable periods of time beyond the actual performance and completion of the projects. Furthermore, many of
the Company’s contracts contain “termination for convenience” provisions, which permit the client to terminate or
cancel the contract at its convenience upon providing the Company with notice a specified period of time before
the termination date and/or paying the Company equitable compensation, depending on the specific contract
terms. In the event that a significant number of the Company’s clients were to avail themselves of such
“termination for convenience” provisions, or if one or more significant contracts were terminated for convenience,
the Company’s reported backlog would be adversely affected, with a corresponding adverse impact on expected
future revenues and profitability.
Contract awards and timing
Obtaining new contract awards, which is a key component for the sustainability of revenues and profitability, is
difficult in a competitive environment. The timing of when project awards will be made is unpredictable and outside
of the Company’s control. The Company operates in highly competitive markets, where it is difficult to predict
whether and when it will receive awards since these awards and projects often involve complex and lengthy
negotiations and bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors, including
elections and change in governments, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, commodity prices,
environmental conditions, and overall market and economic conditions. In addition, the Company may not be
awarded contracts that it has bid on, due to price, the conditions or qualifications applicable to the Company’s bid,
a client’s perception of the Company’s reputation, ability to perform and/or perceived technology or other
advantages held by competitors. The Company’s competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual
risks or accept terms and conditions in a contract that the Company might not deem market or acceptable. Thus,
the Company is subject to the risk of losing new contract awards to competitors, as well as the risk that revenue
may not be derived from awarded projects as quickly as anticipated. Furthermore, the Company may incur
significant costs in order to bid on projects that it may not be awarded, thereby resulting in expenses that failed to
generate any profit for the Company. It should also be noted that the Company’s results of operations can
fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on whether and when projects are awarded. The
timing and progress of any work performed under awarded contracts may further impact the Company’s results of
operations.
In addition, fluctuating demand cycles are common in the engineering and construction industries, and these can
have a significant impact on the degree of competition for available projects and the awarding of new contracts.
As such, fluctuations in the demand for engineering and construction services, or the ability of the private and/or
public sectors to fund projects in a depressed economic climate could adversely affect the awarding of new
contracts and margin and thus, the Company’s results. Given the cyclical nature of the engineering and
construction industries, the financial results of the Company, like others in such industries, may be impacted in

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

157

any given period by a wide variety of factors beyond its control. Therefore, the Company may, from time to time,
be subject to significant and unpredictable variations in its quarterly and annual financial results.
Among other matters, the Company’s estimates of future performance further depend on whether and when it will
be awarded new contracts, including the extent to which the Company utilizes its workforce. The rate at which the
Company utilizes its workforce is impacted by a variety of factors including: the Company’s ability to manage
attrition or attract and recruit talent in a timely manner; the Company’s ability to forecast its need for services,
which in turn allows the Company to maintain an appropriately-sized workforce; the Company’s ability to transition
employees from completed projects to new projects or between internal business groups; and the Company’s
need to devote resources to non-chargeable activities such as training or business development. While the
Company’s estimates are based upon its professional judgement, these estimates can be unreliable, and may
frequently change based on newly available information. In the case of large-scale domestic and international
projects where timing is often uncertain, it is particularly difficult to predict whether, if and when the Company will
be awarded a contract. The uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching the size of the
Company’s workforce with its current needs. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, or if an
ongoing contract is cancelled, the Company could incur costs resulting from reductions in staff, or redundancy of
facilities, which would reduce the Company’s operational efficiency, margins and profits.
Being a provider of services to government agencies
The Company is a provider of services to government agencies, and is therefore exposed to the risks associated
with government contracting. The Company’s failure to comply with the terms of one or more government
contracts or government statutes, regulations and policies could result in the Company’s contracts with
government agencies being terminated, or the Company being suspended or debarred from future government
projects for a significant period of time, possible civil or criminal fines and penalties, and the risk of public scrutiny
of the Company’s performance and potential harm to its reputation, each of which could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s business. Other remedies that the Company’s government clients may seek for improper
activities or performance issues include sanctions such as forfeiture of profits and suspension of payments. In
addition, virtually all of the Company’s contracts with governments contain “termination for convenience”
provisions, as described in the risk factor above entitled “Backlog and contracts with termination for convenience
provisions”.
Government contracts present the Company with additional risks. For instance, legislatures typically appropriate
funds on a year-by-year basis, while contract performance may take several years. As a result, the Company’s
contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated, and the Company may
fail to realize all of its expected potential revenues and profits from those contracts. Moreover, appropriations and
the timing of payment may be influenced by many factors, including the state of the economy, competing political
priorities, curtailments in the use of government contracting firms, budget constraints, and the timing and amount
of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures.
International operations
As previously mentioned, the Company’s strategy involves the focusing of its efforts on its three core regions,
namely the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States - in each of which it has a leading presence, while
maintaining more targeted operations in select markets in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin
America. While international activities can bring benefits from the diversification of the Company’s markets, clientbase and availability of resources, the focus of the Company on a limited number of core regions could reduce
such diversification, such that a declining volume of activities in a given core market could adversely affect the
Company’s financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations.

158

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

A significant portion of the Company’s revenues are attributable to projects in international markets outside of
Canada. The Company’s business is dependent on the continued success of its international operations, and the
Company expects its international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenues.
The Company’s international operations are subject to a variety of risks, many of which also apply to its Canadian
operations, including:
◦

recessions and other economic crises in other regions, or specific foreign economies and the impact on the
Company’s costs of doing business in those countries;

◦

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical, security and communication
challenges;

◦

changes in foreign government policies, laws, regulations and regulatory requirements, or the interpretation,
application and/or enforcement thereof;

◦

difficulty or expense in enforcing contractual rights due to a lack of a developed legal system or otherwise;

◦

renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;

◦

the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other tariffs and restrictions, including those of a
retaliatory or political nature as geopolitical events unfold;

◦

difficulties, delays and expenses that may be experienced or incurred in connection with the movement and
clearance of personnel and goods through the customs and immigration authorities of multiple jurisdictions;

◦

embargoes;

◦

acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure and terrorism;

◦

social, political and economic instability;

◦

expropriation of property;

◦

the risk that inter-governmental relationships may deteriorate such that the Company’s operations in a given
country may be negatively impacted because the Company is head-quartered in Canada, or because it
carries on business in another country;

◦

difficulties, delays and expense that may be experienced in obtaining critical licenses, permits or the like, to
carry on the Company’s business as a result of administrative processes in certain jurisdictions that differ from
those in North America;

◦

tax increases or changes in tax laws, legislation or regulation or in the interpretation, application and/or
enforcement thereof; and

◦

limitations on the Company’s ability to repatriate cash, funds or capital invested or held in jurisdictions outside
Canada.

To the extent the Company’s international or Canadian operations are affected by unexpected or adverse
economic, political and other conditions, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations
may be adversely affected.
In addition, the Company’s activities outside Canada expose the Company to foreign currency exchange risks,
which could adversely impact its operating results. The Company is particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in the
value of the British pound and the U.S. dollar. While the Company has a hedging strategy in place to mitigate
some of the effects of certain foreign currency exposures, there can be no assurance that such hedging strategy
will be effective. The Company does not have hedging strategies in place with respect to all currencies to which it
is exposed in the conduct of its business. The Company’s hedging strategy includes the use of forward foreign
exchange contracts, which also contain an inherent credit risk related to default on obligations by the
counterparties to such contracts. See also Note 29 to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

159

Nuclear liability
The Company’s Nuclear segment supports clients across the entire Nuclear lifecycle with the full spectrum of
services from consultancy, EPCM services, field services, technology services, spare parts, reactor support &
decommissioning and waste management. As stewards of the CANDU® technology, it also provides new-build
and full refurbishment services of CANDU® reactors. Such services can subject the Company to risks arising out
of a nuclear, radiological or criticality incident, whether or not within the Company’s control.
Indemnification provisions contained in the domestic legislation of the jurisdictions in which the Company’s
Nuclear segment operates, such as Canada’s Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act, the United Kingdom’s
Nuclear Installations Act 1965, the United States’ Price-Anderson Act, or equivalent protections afforded under
international conventions, seek to ensure compensation for the general public, while indemnifying nuclear industry
participants against liability arising from nuclear incidents, subject to possible exclusions.
However, these legislative indemnification provisions may not apply to all liabilities incurred while performing
services as a contractor for the nuclear industry. If an incident or certain damages resulting therefrom are not
covered under applicable legislative indemnification provisions, the Company could be held liable for damages
which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. In
addition to legislative indemnification provisions, the Company seeks to protect itself from any liability associated
with nuclear incidents and damages resulting therefrom in its contracts, but there can be no assurance that such
contractual limitations on liability will be effective in all cases, or that the Company’s or its clients’ insurance will
cover all liabilities assumed under those contracts. The costs of defending against claims arising out of a nuclear
incident, and any damages that could be awarded as a result of such claims, could have a material adverse
impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Ownership interests in investments
The Company holds investments, mainly through its Capital segment, which acts as the Company’s investment
and asset management arm. When the Company holds an ownership interest in an investment, it assumes a
degree of risk associated with the financial performance of the investment. The value of the Company’s
investment is dependent on the ability of the investment to attain its revenue and cost projections as well as the
ability to secure initial and ongoing financing, which can be influenced by numerous factors, some of which are
partially beyond the Company’s control, including, but not limited to, political or legislative changes, lifecycle
maintenance, operating revenues, collection success, cost management and the general state of the capital and/
or credit markets.
The Company sometimes makes investments in project entities in which it does not hold a controlling interest.
These investments may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control
over financial reporting that the Company follows. To the extent the controlling entity makes decisions that
negatively impact such investments or internal controls relating thereto and, consequently, problems arise with
such investments, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.
The Company’s non-recourse debt from its investments can be affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hedging
strategy is put in place when the management body of the project entity for such investment deems it appropriate.
However, the assumptions and estimates inherent to the hedging strategy could be erroneous, thus rendering the
hedging strategy ineffective or partially ineffective. Furthermore, the financial instruments associated with the
hedging strategy contain an inherent credit risk related to defaults on obligations by the counterparties to such
instruments.
In addition, many of the Company's investments are governed by shareholder, partnership or similar joint venture
agreements or arrangements, many of which restrict the Company’s ability or right to freely sell or otherwise
dispose of its investments and/or that affect the timing of any such sale or other disposition. Consequently, the
Company’s ability to efficiently or timely dispose of or monetize one or more of its investments could be limited by
such contractual arrangements, which could in turn have an adverse impact on the Company’s liquidity or capital
resources.

160

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Dependence on third parties
The Company undertakes contracts wherein it subcontracts a portion of the project or the supply of material and
equipment to third parties. If the amount the Company is required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and
supplies exceeds what was estimated, the Company may suffer losses on these contracts. If a supplier or
subcontractor fails to provide supplies, equipment or services as required under a negotiated contract for any
reason, or provides supplies, equipment or services that are not of an acceptable quality or quantity, the Company
may be required to source those supplies, equipment or services on a delayed basis or at a higher price than
anticipated. This could in turn impact contract profitability. In addition, faulty equipment or materials could impact
the overall project, resulting in claims against the Company for failure to meet required project specifications.
These risks may be intensified during an economic downturn if these suppliers or subcontractors experience
financial difficulties or find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to fund their operations or access to bonding, and
are not able to provide the services or supplies (altogether or on a timely basis) or the requisite quality or grade of
services or supplies necessary for the Company’s business.
In addition, in instances where the Company relies on a single contracted supplier or subcontractor, or a small
number of suppliers or subcontractors, there can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide these
products or services on a timely basis, or at the costs the Company had anticipated, and the bankruptcy or
insolvency of one or more suppliers or subcontractors on whom the Company substantially depends for one or
more particular project(s) or contract(s) would also adversely impact the Company. Furthermore, irrespective of
the importance or number of project or Company subcontractors or suppliers, general global supply chain
disruptions and issues outside the control of the Company could adversely affect ongoing operations also
resulting in the aforementioned risks to the Company. A failure by a third-party subcontractor or supplier to comply
with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact the Company’s business and/or reputation and,
in the case of government contracts, could also result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being
imposed on the Company, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on the Company’s reputation,
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Supply chain disruptions
Global disruptions in supply chains continue to affect companies in a variety of industries, triggering widespread
impacts. Shortages and logistical bottlenecks with labour and transportation have, in certain instances, led to a
shortage of material availability and an increase in shipping costs. Illness, travel restrictions and other workforce
disruptions could adversely affect the Company’s supply chain, as well as its ability to complete its clients’ projects
in the scheduled time frame. In addition, the shortage of material availability and increased shipping costs could
also adversely affect its profitability, notably through inflationary price pressure on material used on certain
contracts and increased prolongation costs.
Joint arrangements and partnerships
The Company enters into certain contracts with partners, as a member of partnerships, and under other similar
arrangements. This situation exposes the Company to a number of risks, including the risk that its partners may
be unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company or its clients. The Company’s partners
may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. Should any
of these situations arise, the Company may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages, provide
additional services, or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the
contracted services. Under agreements with joint and several (or solidary) liabilities, the Company could be liable
for both its obligations and those of its partners. These circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation
with the Company’s partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company participates in joint arrangements and similar partnerships, in which it is not the leading partner. In
these cases, the Company may have limited control over the actions or decisions of the joint arrangement or
partnership. These structures may not be subject to the same governance framework and corresponding
requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that the Company follows. To

the extent the leading partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint arrangement or partnership or
internal control problems arise within the joint arrangement or partnership, there could be a resulting material
adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The failure by a partner in a joint arrangement or partnership to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations,
or contract requirements, could negatively impact the Company’s business and reputation and, in the case of
government contracts, could also result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on the
Company, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on the Company’s reputation, business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Information systems and data and compliance with privacy legislation
The integrity, reliability and security of information in all forms are critical to the Company’s daily and strategic
operations.
The Company relies on a core set of information technologies and systems, each of which requires maintenance
and support and which may experience interruptions, deficiencies, delays or cessations of service in connection
with systems maintenance, integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. The Company may
not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, and this could cause disruptions in the
Company’s business and divert Company resources, and such new systems may not achieve the desired
business objectives. Any damage, disruption or shutdown of the Company’s information systems, or the failure to
successfully implement new or upgraded systems, depending on the specific set of circumstances, could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as its
operations.
Furthermore, cyber-attacks have become more frequent and sophisticated, and the Company’s information
technology and other defenses must be adequate at all times to repel them. Cyber-attacks can involve malware
(including ransomware), hacking, industrial espionage, unauthorized access to confidential or proprietary
information, phishing or other security breaches and system disruptions. Should the Company be unable to
protect its information systems, they could be interrupted, slowed down or fail altogether. The Company’s
information systems and operations could also be interrupted or damaged by natural disasters, failures, acts of
war or terrorism, or other events beyond the Company’s control. Furthermore, for employees working from home
on a regular or an occasional basis, technology in employees’ homes is not as robust as in the Company’s offices,
which may contribute to an increase in the number of potential points of attack and greater cybersecurity risks.
A successful cyber-attack could harm the Company’s reputation and adversely affect its business, financial
condition and results of operations, as such an attack may lead to network failures; unauthorized access to
confidential or proprietary information about its business, assets, customers or employees; theft, loss, leakage,
destruction or corruption of data, including information about its customers or employees; physical damage to
network assets; litigation, fines and liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws or
contracts; fraud; lost revenues; the potential for loss of customers or impairment of the Company’s ability to attract
new customers; higher insurance premiums or difficulties or inability to obtain insurance coverage; and the
Company incurring significant costs payable to specialist advisors, such as forensic and external communications/
public relations experts, to assist the Company in dealing with such cyber-attacks and the consequences thereof.
In addition, cyber-attacks affecting the Company’s suppliers or other business partners could also adversely affect
the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
As a company that operates globally, the Company is subject to a complex array of legislation designed to protect
personal and confidential information. Privacy and data protection legislation and regulations are in constant
evolution, and it can be anticipated that more countries will establish personal data protection frameworks over
time.
The constantly evolving nature of technology and applicable privacy and data protection legislation and
regulations pose increasingly complex compliance challenges for the Company, and may trigger higher spending
by the Company to meet the requirements thereof. Any failure to comply with existing laws and regulations could
result in significant penalties, legal liability and reputational risk for the Company.

162

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The Company uses security measures and technology to protect the confidential and proprietary information on
its computer and information technology systems. The Company adapts its security policies, procedures and
controls to protect its assets, as the threat to them evolves. There is no assurance that these measures will
prevent the occurrence of cyber-attacks, or that any insurance the Company may have will cover the costs,
damages, liabilities or losses that could result therefrom.
Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and other innovative technologies
The adoption of AI and other innovative technologies for improved decision-making and process optimization can
benefit the Company in many ways, such as reducing the time and resources required to perform certain tasks,
leveraging the expertise of its employees in certain fields of activities, and increasing its competitiveness in certain
markets, to name a few. While not adopting such technologies could be a threat to the Company’s ability to adapt
and evolve in its competitive markets, their adoption also poses risks related to potential data vulnerability,
malicious use in criminal or inappropriate activities and unintended consequences on customer trust and
confidence. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that investments made in these technologies and related
processes and tools will provide a valuable return, if any, to the Company.
Qualified personnel
The success of the Company depends heavily on its workforce and its ability to attract, recruit, develop and retain
qualified personnel in a competitive work environment. Engineers, architects, designers, project managers, as
well as functional experts and corporate leadership professionals who possess both experience and skills that
match the current and future needs of the marketplace are essential to the success of the Company’s business.
The pace of technology advances requires the Company to devote significant time and resources to training its
employees in order to provide them with relevant skills and capabilities to meet client needs. The ability to retain
and motivate qualified personnel, or attract suitable replacements as needed, is dependent on, among other
things, the competitive nature of the employment market and the career opportunities and compensation that the
Company can offer. Furthermore, having employees working from home on a regular or occasional basis could
potentially affect productivity and efficiency of certain employees and potentially have negative effects on
workplace morale and employees’ sense of common purpose and belonging to the organization.
There is increasingly strong competition for qualified technical and management personnel in the Company’s
industry, and if the Company were to lose some or all of these personnel, they could be difficult to replace in the
timeline demanded by the Company’s clients. For example, some of the Company’s personnel hold governmentgranted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects. If the Company were to lose some or all of
these personnel, they could be difficult to replace. The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel would
place increased demands on the Company’s existing resources. This could result in, among other things, lost
opportunities, cost overruns, failure to successfully complete existing projects and to compete for new ones, and
inability to mitigate risks and uncertainties.
In addition, should the Company’s corporate leadership professionals and other key personnel retire or otherwise
leave the Company, the Company would be required to have an appropriate succession plan in place. Existing
staff may need to be retrained to fill the roles of departed staff, and, wherever necessary, the Company would
need to identify and recruit potential external candidates for key roles. The Company would need to successfully
implement such plans, which would require devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new
personnel into leadership roles and other key positions. Should the Company fail to effectively prepare and
implement an effective succession plan, there could be a material adverse effect on its ability to conduct its
business effectively, and to provide services to its clients until qualified replacements are found.
Strategic direction
In mid-2019, the Company began implementing a new strategic direction, focused on the high-performing and
growth areas of the business as it exits LSTK construction contracting. In September 2021, the Company unveiled
a three-year global strategic growth plan, and re-affirmed its strategy comprised of four core elements, namely:

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

163

(i) focusing on core geographic areas of operation and end customer markets, targeted in the built and natural
environment; (ii) leveraging the Company’s unique end-to-end global capabilities, in order to deliver high value
products and services locally; (iii) identifying key growth areas; and (iv) establishing capital allocation priorities to
strengthen business and drive further value creation opportunities. The strategy involves the Company focusing
its efforts on its three core regions— the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, in each of which it has
a leading presence, while maintaining more targeted operations in select markets in Europe, the Middle East,
Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. Within these geographies, the Company focuses on seven clearly defined
customer end markets, namely the Transportation, Buildings and Places, Defence, Water, Industrial and Minerals,
Power and Renewables, and Nuclear sectors.
The Company’s continued ability to execute on and advance its strategic direction may be affected by various
factors, notably that until the exit from LSTK construction projects is completed (by the run-off or transfer of
existing projects and the resolution of related claims), the Company may experience further losses resulting from
the risks inherent in such projects. In addition, it may be necessary for the Company to accept change orders
under existing LSTK construction contracts, which may temporarily extend the performance timeframe of such
contracts, and increase or prolong the Company’s financial and legal exposure under the relevant projects as a
result thereof.
Implementation of any strategic direction presents various managerial, organizational, administrative, operational
and other challenges.
If the Company is unable to successfully execute on any or all of the initiatives contemplated under its strategic
direction, the Company’s revenues, operating results and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if the
Company successfully implements this strategic direction, there can be no guarantee that it will achieve its
intended objectives. Modifications to this strategic direction may also be required to achieve such objectives,
which could delay or temporarily pause its implementation.
Competition
The Company operates businesses in highly competitive industry segments and geographic markets, both in
Canada and internationally. The Company competes with large, mid-sized and smaller companies alike, across a
range of industry segments. In addition, an increase in international companies entering into the Canadian
marketplace and/or non-traditional competitors and international markets entering any industry segments where
the Company is present has also made such markets more competitive. New contract awards and contract
margins are dependent on the level of competition and the general state of the markets in which the Company
operates. Fluctuations in demand in the segments in which the Company operates may impact the degree of
competition for work. Competitive position is based on a multitude of factors, including pricing, ability to obtain
adequate bonding, backlog, financial strength, appetite for risk, availability of partners, suppliers and workforce,
and reputation for quality, timeliness and experience. If the Company is unable to effectively respond to these
competitive factors, its results of operations and financial condition will be adversely impacted. In addition, a
prolonged economic slump or slower than anticipated recovery may also result in increased competition in certain
market segments, price or margin reductions or decreased demand which may adversely affect results.
Professional liability or liability for faulty services
The Company’s failure to act or to make judgements and recommendations in accordance with applicable
professional standards could result in large monetary damages awards against the Company. The Company’s
business involves making professional judgements regarding the planning, design, development and construction
of multiple projects, as well as the operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure
projects. A failure or incident at one of the Company’s project sites or completed projects resulting from the work it
has performed could result in significant professional or product liability, warranty or other claims against the
Company as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. These liabilities could exceed the
Company’s insurance limits or the fees it generates, or could impact the Company’s ability to obtain insurance in
the future. See the “Insurance coverage” risk factor below. In addition, clients or subcontractors who have agreed
to indemnify the Company against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay. An uninsured

164

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

claim, either in part or in whole, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a material adverse impact
on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
In some jurisdictions where the Company does business, it may be held jointly and severally (solidarily) liable for
both its obligations and those of other parties working on a particular project, notwithstanding the absence of a
contractual relationship between the Company and such other parties.
Monetary damages and penalties in connection with professional and engineering reports and opinions
The Company issues reports and opinions to clients based on its professional engineering expertise, as well as its
other professional credentials. The Company’s reports and opinions are often required to comply with professional
standards, licensing and technical requirements, securities regulations and other laws, regulations, rules and
standards governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are
performed. In addition, the Company could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon the Company’s reports
or opinions, even if it is not contractually bound to those third parties, which may result in monetary damages or
penalties.
Gaps in insurance coverage
As part of the Company’s business operations, AtkinsRéalis maintains a certain level of insurance coverage.
There can be no assurance that the Company has in place sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy its needs, or
that it will be able to secure all necessary or sufficient insurance coverage in the future. The Company’s insurance
is purchased from a number of third-party insurers, often in layered insurance arrangements. If any of its thirdparty insurers fail, refuse to renew or revoke coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to
AtkinsRéalis, or if the Company is found liable on or pays out a significant claim in respect of a project or contract
that is not covered by any insurance, then the Company’s overall risk exposure and operational expenses could
be increased and its business operations could be interrupted.
The Company has obtained directors’ and officers’ liability insurance insuring directors and officers against liability
for acts or omissions in their capacities as directors and officers of the Company, subject to certain exclusions.
Such insurance also insures the Company against losses which the Company may incur in indemnifying officers
and directors. In addition, the Company may enter into indemnification agreements with key officers and directors
and such persons may also have indemnification rights under applicable laws and the Company’s constating
documents. The Company’s obligations to indemnify directors and officers may pose substantial risks to the
Company’s financial condition as AtkinsRéalis may not be able to maintain its insurance or, even if the Company
is able to maintain its insurance, claims in excess of the Company’s insurance coverage and/or claims not
covered by insurance could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, and operating results.
Health and safety
The nature of the Company’s work places employees and other individuals near large equipment, dangerous
processes or highly regulated materials, and in challenging environments. Many clients require that the Company
meet certain safety standards or criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts, and the payment of a portion of the
Company’s contract fees or profits may be subject to satisfying safety standards or criteria. Unsafe work
conditions may also increase employee turnover, increasing project and operating costs and could negatively
impact the awarding of new contracts. If the Company or any third party such as clients or partners fail to
implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if the procedures fail, employees as well as other individuals may
suffer injuries. Failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations could subject the
Company to losses and liability, and adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition and operating
results, as well as its ability to obtain future projects.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

165

Work stoppages, union negotiations and other labour matters
A portion of the Company’s workforce and employees working for various subcontractors are unionized. A lengthy
strike or other work stoppages, caused by unionized or non-unionized employees, in connection with any of the
Company’s projects could have a material adverse effect on the Company. There is an inherent risk that ongoing
or future negotiations related to collective bargaining agreements or union representation may not be favourable
to the Company. From time to time, the Company has also faced attempts to unionize the Company’s nonunionized employees. Such efforts can often disrupt or delay work and present risk of labour unrest.
Epidemics, pandemics and other health crises
A significant outbreak, epidemic or pandemic of contagious diseases in any geographic area in which we operate,
such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in a public health and safety crisis that could adversely affect our
business, national and international economies, financial markets and overall demand for our services. The
COVID-19 global pandemic significantly disrupted global health, economic, market and labour conditions, and
created significant volatility and negative pressures on all national economies.
Potential future epidemics, pandemics or other global health and safety crises, including potential future
developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition,
liquidity, future results of operations and outlook.
Both the COVID-19 pandemic and other health crises of a similar scale or scope may also have the effect of
heightening other risks and uncertainties disclosed and described in this “Risks and Uncertainties” section of this
MD&A.
Global climate change, extreme weather conditions and the impact of natural or other disasters
The general effects of global climate change, along with the unpredictability of extreme weather conditions and
other natural disasters, could affect the Company’s operations and profitability. As with the rest of the global
economy and similar to other engineering services and projects-driven companies, the Company is exposed to
the physical risks related to climate change, including increases in the frequency and intensity of weather-related
events, such as storms, floods, wildfires and heatwaves, or longer-term changes, such as temperature changes
and rising sea levels. Furthermore, the Company’s field activities are generally performed outdoors, and include
professional surveying, resident engineering services, field data surveys and collection, archeology, geotechnical
investigations and exploratory drilling, construction oversight and inspection, plant start-up and testing and plant
operations. Extreme weather conditions or natural or other disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, floods,
tornadoes, hurricanes, lightning and similar events, may cause postponement of the initiation and/or completion of
the Company’s field activities and may hinder the ability of the Company’s employees, subcontractors or suppliers
to perform their duties, which may result in delays or loss of revenues that otherwise would be recognized, while
certain costs continue to be incurred. Extreme weather conditions or disasters may also delay or eliminate the
start and/or completion of various phases of work relating to other services that commence concurrently with or
subsequent to field activities. Any delay in the completion of the Company’s services may require the Company to
incur additional non-compensable costs, including overtime work, that are necessary to meet clients’ schedules.
Due to various factors, a delay in the commencement or completion of a project may also result in penalties or
sanctions under contracts or even the cancellation of contracts.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
The Company is subject to increased pressure to comply with regulatory requirements, meet stakeholder
expectations and address environmental, social and governance issues. These include environmental, social and
governance risks, including climate change as described in the “Global climate change, extreme weather
conditions and the impact of natural or other disasters” risk factor above. Different stakeholder groups may have
divergent views on environmental, social and governance related matters, which increases the risk that any
action, or inaction, by the Company could be perceived negatively by at least some stakeholders.

166

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

In addition to the physical risks associated with extreme weather conditions and global climate change, there are
also transition risks as the global economy shifts to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy. These transition risks
may arise from climate-related policy changes, technological changes and behavioral changes, including client
preferences toward lower-carbon products and services. As part of ongoing international, national, local and
internal initiatives such as Net Zero 2030, the Company recognizes the urgency in taking concrete measures, is
focusing on pioneering solutions in addressing climate change and climate resiliency, and has formally committed
to a variety of climate risk mitigation actions and to meeting climate change related targets and deadlines,
including in connection with its 2022 Credit Agreement, under which the overall borrowing costs will either
increase or decrease depending on whether the Company meets certain ESG targets set forth therein. The
Company’s industry expertise and commitment to reducing the material effects of climate change aim to limit the
negative effects of climate change on its business, as well as the global community. However, the Company may
be required to incur significant costs to improve the climate-related resiliency of its infrastructure and otherwise
prepare for, respond to, and mitigate the effects of climate change, and there can be no guarantee that such
mitigation efforts will effectively negate or adequately shield the Company from the effects of such climate-change
related risks.
In addition to the ESG targets set forth in the 2022 Credit Agreement, in 2022, the Company disclosed certain
ESG goals and targets, including, among other things, reducing its Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 60% by
2030, transitioning existing offices and facilities to low carbon alternatives, achieving Net Zero by 2030, achieving
25% of women in managers and senior professionals and executives and 33% of women across the organization
by 2025, and maintaining 30% of board representation by women. While the Company has begun implementing
measures aimed at making progress on such goals and targets, there is no guarantee that the Company will be
able to attain such goals and targets, either in whole or in part, including as a result of legal, regulatory, industry
and broader market trends that may be outside of the Company’s control. Failure to appropriately implement
measures to achieve the Company’s stated ESG goals and targets, as well as to actually meet such ESG goals
and targets in the specified timeframes or at all, may result in reputational risk to the Company and could cause
certain investors to be less interested in purchasing or in remaining invested in the Company’s securities. In
addition, failure to meet the ESG targets set out in the Company’s 2022 Credit Agreement could, as previously
noted, result in higher overall borrowing costs, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial
condition and operating results.
Greenhouse gas inventories involve a level of scientific and engineering complexity that includes the use of
available performance data, greenhouse gas emission factors, model assumptions, and various methodologies.
The models using these data inputs, assumptions, and methodologies to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions
introduce uncertainty. In some cases, data may not be available or may be assessed as incomplete. In these
instances it is necessary to use estimates that introduce a greater degree of uncertainty into the greenhouse gas
inventory. Disclosures of the Company’s progress and performance towards reaching ESG objectives are an
integral part of the Company’s engagement in these initiatives. Such disclosures are likely to be increasingly
subject to internal controls, third party validation, audits and publicly available industry rankings and company
ratings and scores. The Company’s inability to generate reliable and complete data, to successfully fulfill all or any
of its engagements and meet its stated ESG-related targets or to attain favorable ESG-related ratings and scores
could adversely affect the Company’s reputation. In addition, under current laws and evolving climate and
sustainability-related regulations, making exaggerated or misleading sustainability claims or “greenwashing”,
either intentionally or due to data collection and reporting challenges, or otherwise, creates legal and reputational
risks. Reputational damage either as a result of the Company’s failure to appropriately implement measures to
achieve the Company’s stated ESG goals and targets, to actually meet such ESG goals and targets in the
specified timeframes or at all and/or to appropriately report on the achievement of such ESG goals and targets
may influence the Company’s ability to obtain future projects, negatively affect relationships with clients on
ongoing projects or cause the cancellation of current projects, limit the Company’s ability and success in retaining
and attracting talent, or negatively impact the Company’s standing with financing and investment stakeholders,
potentially leading to less favorable financing conditions or decline in investor interest.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

167

Divestitures and the sale of significant assets
The sale of a business unit and/or significant assets is a complex process that involves certain risks, such as
failure to properly plan, prepare and execute the transaction and to prepare a contract that is intended to protect
the Company from post-closing adjustments, certain liabilities and additional costs. In addition, the Company is
exposed to the risk of the sale falling through, selling at a lower price than the asking price, the buyer not
respecting, or not being in a financial or other position to respect, its post-closing contractual obligations, and/or
extended time to complete transactions.
The divestment of businesses involves risks and uncertainties, such as the difficulty in separating assets directly
related to the businesses sold from the businesses the Company retains, senior management and employee
distraction, the need to obtain regulatory approvals and other third-party consents, which can potentially disrupt
customer and supplier relationships, and the fact that the Company may be subject to additional tax obligations or
losses of certain tax benefits. Such actions also involve significant costs, and require the time and attention of
management, which may divert attention from other business operations. Because of these challenges, as well as
market conditions or other factors, divestitures may take longer and/or be costlier, or generate fewer benefits than
expected, or may not be completed at all. If the Company is unable to complete its intended divestitures or
successfully transition divested businesses, its business and financial results could be negatively impacted. If the
Company disposes of a business, it may not be able to successfully cause a buyer of a divested business to
assume the liabilities of that business or, even if such liabilities are assumed, the Company may have difficulties
enforcing its rights, contractual or otherwise, against the buyer. The Company may retain exposure on financial or
performance guarantees and other contractual, employment, pension and severance obligations, and potential
liabilities that may arise under law because of the disposition or the subsequent failure of a buyer. As a result, the
performance of the divested businesses or other conditions outside of the Company’s control could have a
material adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, many contracts for the sale of a subsidiary or a
business provide for the delivery of closing financial statements and, depending on the results of the closing
financial statements, the buyer could assert a claim, whether founded or not, that the Company, as seller, is
obligated to pay certain sums, even material sums, as a post-closing adjustment to the buyer after completion of
the transaction and, depending on the amount of any such post-closing adjustment payment that the Company
may be required (or decides) to pay, such a payment could have an adverse or even a material adverse impact on
the Company’s cash resources, liquidity and/or its financial results and performance. Conversely, the right to
assert a similar claim is generally also available to the Company against a buyer, depending on the results of the
closing financial statements. Moreover, the divestiture of any business could negatively impact the Company’s
profitability because of losses that may result from such a sale, the loss of revenues or a decrease in cash flows.
Following a divestiture, the Company may also have less diversity in its business and in the markets it serves, as
well as in its client base.
Intellectual property
The Company’s success depends, in part, upon its ability to protect its intellectual property and intellectual
property rights. The Company relies on a combination of intellectual property policies and other contractual
arrangements to protect much of its intellectual property, where it does not believe that trademark, patent or
copyright protection is appropriate or obtainable. Trade secrets are generally difficult to protect. Although the
Company’s employees and clients are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to
deter or prevent misappropriation of the Company’s confidential information and/or the infringement of the
Company’s patents and copyrights. Furthermore, the Company may be unable to detect any unauthorized use of
its intellectual property, or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce its rights. Failure to adequately protect,
maintain, or enforce the Company’s intellectual property rights may adversely limit the Company’s competitive
position and/or adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.

168

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY’S LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL POSITION
Liquidity and financial position
The Company relies on its cash, credit facilities and other debt instruments, as well as the capital markets to
satisfy some of its liquidity and capital requirements, and it is, in certain instances, required to obtain bank
guarantees or letters of credit as a means to secure its various contractual obligations for its underlying projects.
Significant instability or disruptions of capital markets or a deterioration in or weakening of its financial position
due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit the Company’s access to, or significantly increase the
cost of one or more of these financing sources, including credit facilities, the issuance of medium- and long-term
debt (such as the issuance of debentures, bonds or notes), or the availability of bank guarantees or letters of
credit to guarantee its contractual and project obligations. There can be no assurance that the Company will
maintain an adequate cash balance and generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount to enable
itself to fund its operations, satisfy its liquidity needs, service its debt and/or maintain its ability to obtain and
secure bank guarantees.
Moreover, a deterioration in the Company’s financial condition could also result in a reduction or downgrade of its
credit ratings. This could limit the Company’s ability to issue new letters of credit or performance guarantees or
access external sources of short-term and long-term debt financing. In addition, this could significantly increase
the costs associated with utilizing any letters of credit and performance guarantees, bank credit facilities and
issuing medium-term and long-term debt, which would in turn have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.
A draw on letters of credit or bank guarantees by one or more third parties could, among other things, significantly
worsen the Company’s cash position, and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and
results of operations.
Indebtedness
The Company had approximately $2.0 billion of consolidated indebtedness as at December 31, 2023 under
recourse, limited recourse and non-recourse debt presented on its statement of financial position.
The Company will need to refinance or reimburse amounts outstanding under the Company’s consolidated
indebtedness. There can be no assurance that any indebtedness of the Company will be refinanced, or that
additional financing on commercially reasonable terms will be obtained, if at all.
The Company’s degree of leverage could have other important consequences, including the following:
◦

it may have a negative effect on the current credit ratings of the Company’s rated long-term debt;

◦

it may limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt
service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes on commercially reasonable
terms, if at all;

◦

most of the Company’s borrowings are at variable rates of interest, exposing the Company to the risk of
increased interest rates and a resulting increase in financial expenses;

◦

it may limit the Company’s ability to adjust to changing market conditions, and place the Company at a
competitive disadvantage (including if the Company’s credit rating is negatively affected) compared to its
competitors that have less debt or greater financial resources;

◦

it may limit the Company’s ability to declare and pay dividends on its common shares or to buy back its own
shares;

◦

the Company may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions; and

◦

the Company may be unable to make capital expenditures that are important to its growth and strategies.

The credit facilities and instruments governing the Company’s consolidated debt contain certain financial
covenants requiring the Company, on a consolidated basis, to satisfy net recourse debt to adjusted EBITDA

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

169

ratios. Such credit facilities and instruments also contain covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur liens
on its assets, incur additional debt or effect dispositions of assets or fundamental changes in its business, pay
dividends and make certain other disbursements, or use the proceeds from the sale of assets and capital stock of
subsidiaries. These covenants limit the Company’s discretion and financial flexibility in the operation of its
business. Under the terms of these credit facilities and instruments, the Company and its subsidiaries are
permitted to incur additional debt only in certain circumstances. However, doing so could increase the risks
described above. In addition, if the Company or its subsidiaries incur additional debt in the future, the Company
may be subject to additional covenants, which may be more restrictive than those that it is subject to now.
A breach of any of these agreements or the Company’s inability to comply with these covenants (as the case may
be) could, if not cured or waived, result in an acceleration of the Company’s consolidated debt or a cross-default
under certain of its debt instruments. If the Company’s indebtedness is accelerated, the Company may not be
able to service its indebtedness, or borrow sufficient funds to refinance its indebtedness.
The Company’s ability to service its consolidated debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial
and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, interest rate fluctuations
(including as a result of whether or not the Company meets the ESG targets set forth in its 2022 Credit
Agreement, which would result in an increase or decrease in the overall borrowing costs under such 2022 Credit
Agreement depending on whether such ESG targets are met or not) and financial, business, legal, regulatory and
other factors, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. If the Company’s operating results or liquidity are
not sufficient to service its current or future consolidated indebtedness, the Company may be forced to take
actions such as reducing dividends, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital
expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing its debt, or seeking additional equity capital.
Impact of operating results and level of indebtedness on financial situation
As outlined in Section 8.4 of this MD&A, the Company is required to maintain a ratio of net recourse debt to
EBITDA not to exceed a certain threshold. While the Company met its covenant requirements in both 2023 and
2022, an increase of net recourse debt due to items such as cash requirements of operating activities or the
delay/acceleration of certain investing/divestiture or financing transactions, or an inability to generate sufficient
adjusted EBITDA to support the level of indebtedness in the ratio calculation in the future, could have a negative
impact on the Company, as further described in the “Indebtedness” risk factor above.
Security under the CDPQ Loan Agreement
The CDPQ Loan is secured by all of Highway Holding’s assets, excluding the Highway 407 ETR shares held by
Highway Holding (until such time as Highway Holding may elect to grant a pledge thereon), as well as the rights
and loan receivables of Highway Holding under the intercompany loan agreement, dated July 10, 2017, as
amended and extended from time to time, between Highway Holding, as lender, and the Company, as borrower.
In addition to this security, AtkinsRéalis Canada Inc. (previously, SNC-Lavalin Inc.) has provided a guarantee (the
“Guarantee”) in favour of CDPQ RF secured by a pledge given by AtkinsRéalis Canada Inc. to CDPQ RF over
20,900 common shares held by AtkinsRéalis Canada Inc. in the share capital of Highway Holding (representing
approximately 29.9% of the outstanding common shares of Highway Holding). CDPQ RF’s sole recourse against
AtkinsRéalis Canada Inc. in connection with the Guarantee and any potential breach or default by Highway
Holding under the CDPQ Loan Agreement is limited to enforcement on or against the shares of the capital of
Highway Holding held by AtkinsRéalis Canada Inc. The Company has a 6.76% ownership interest in Highway 407
ETR through Highway Holding. The terms of the CDPQ Loan Agreement include various covenants that must be
satisfied by Highway Holding. There can be no assurance that such covenants will be satisfied. Any event of
default under the CDPQ Loan Agreement, including in respect of covenants thereunder, could result in, among
other things, CDPQ RF demanding immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the CDPQ Loan
Agreement, or forcing the sale of the Highway 407 ETR shares held by Highway Holding in compliance with the
Highway 407 ETR shareholders’ agreement at a time, price and in circumstances outside of the Company’s
control and/or that may not allow for an optimal sale price of such Highway 407 ETR shares, which could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial position.

170

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Dependence on subsidiaries to help repay indebtedness
A significant portion of the Company’s assets are the capital stock of its subsidiaries and the Company conducts
an important portion of its business through its subsidiaries. Consequently, the Company’s cash flow and ability to
service its debt obligations are dependent to a great extent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries, and the
distribution of those earnings to the Company, or upon loans, advances or other payments made by these entities
to the Company.
The Company’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities, and may have significant liabilities. The ability
of these entities to pay dividends or make other loans, advances or payments to the Company will depend upon
their operating results, and will be subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions contained in the
instruments governing their debt including, for example, the financial covenants set out in the CDPQ Loan
Agreement, pursuant to which the Company’s consolidated net recourse debt to adjusted earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio cannot exceed a certain limit. In addition, certain other deeds and
agreements governing certain subsidiaries of the Company contain restrictions on the payment of dividends and
distributions, as well as specified liquidity covenants. Also, a number of the Company’s material subsidiaries have
provided guarantees of the Company’s primary third-party debt instruments and obligations, including the
Company’s 2022 Credit Agreement and its outstanding debentures.
The ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations depends on their future
financial performance, which will in turn be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors,
including those discussed in this section, many of which are outside of the control of the Company or its
subsidiaries. The cash flow and earnings of the Company’s operating subsidiaries and the amount that they are
able to distribute to the Company as dividends or otherwise may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations
to satisfy the Company’s debt obligations. Accordingly, the Company may have to undertake alternative financing
plans, such as refinancing or restructuring its debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or
seeking to raise additional capital. The Company cannot ensure that any such alternatives would be possible, that
any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those
sales, that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms (if at all), or that additional financing would
be permitted under the terms of the Company’s various debt instruments then in effect. The Company’s inability to
generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, or to refinance its obligations on commercially
reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Dividends
The declaration and payment of dividends on common shares are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the
Company. The cash available for dividends is a function of numerous factors, including the Company’s financial
performance, the impact of interest rates, debt covenants and obligations, working capital requirements and future
capital requirements. In addition, the Company’s ability to pay dividends depends upon the payment of dividends
by some of the Company’s subsidiaries or the repayment of funds to the Company by its subsidiaries. The
Company’s subsidiaries may, in turn, be restricted from paying dividends, making repayments or making other
distributions to the Company for financial, regulatory, legal or other reasons. To the extent that the Company’s
subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or repay funds to the Company, it may adversely affect the Company’s
ability to pay dividends on common shares.
Post-employment benefit obligations, including pension-related obligations
The Company operates certain defined benefits plans, and provides other post-employment benefits. More
specifically, the Company operates two significant defined benefit plans, namely the Atkins Pension Plan and the
Railways Pension Scheme, with significant retirement benefit obligations. The majority of the Company’s
post-employment benefit obligations sit within its U.K. business and are comprised of defined benefit pension
obligations. In the U.K., defined benefit pension schemes funding requirements are based on actuarial valuations
of the assets and liabilities of each scheme. Scheme’s assets are mainly determined by the value of investments
held by the scheme and the returns. The valuation of plan liabilities requires a significant degree of professional

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

171

judgement and technical expertise in choosing appropriate assumptions. Changes in a number of key
assumptions, such as the discount rate employed and the rate of compensation increase or inflation, can have a
material impact on the calculation of the obligations. There is also some judgement in the measurement of the fair
value of pension assets giving rise to a risk of material misstatement in their valuation.
The nature of the funding regime in the U.K. creates uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of cash
that the Company will be required to pay to the pension schemes. The contribution to the Atkins Pension Plan and
the Railways Pension Scheme from the Company totaled £23.0 million (or approximately CA$38.6 million) and
£6.1 million (or approximately CA$10.2 million), respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023. If the
Company is required to increase its cash funding contributions, this will reduce the availability of funds for other
corporate purposes, and limits its ability to invest in growth. Deteriorating economic conditions may result in
significant increases in the Company’s funding obligations, which could restrict available cash for the Company’s
operations, capital expenditures and other requirements, and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company’s post-employment benefit obligations, including its pension-related liabilities and its future
payment obligations thereunder, could restrict cash available for the Company’s operations, capital expenditures
and other requirements, and may materially adversely affect its financial condition and liquidity.
Working capital requirements
The Company may require significant amounts of working capital to finance the purchase of materials and/or the
performance of engineering, construction and other work on certain projects before it receives payment from
clients. In some cases, the Company is contractually obliged to its clients to fund working capital on projects.
Increases in working capital requirements could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition
and cash flows.
Additionally, the Company could temporarily experience a liquidity shortfall if it is unable to access its cash
balances and/or short-term investments or draw on facilities under its 2022 Credit Agreement to meet the
Company’s working capital requirements. The Company’s cash balances and short-term investments are in
accounts held by banks and financial institutions, and some of the Company’s deposits exceed available
insurance. There is a risk that these banks and financial institutions may, in the future, go bankrupt, be forced into
receivership, or that their assets may be seized by their governments, thereby causing the Company to
experience a temporary liquidity shortfall or failure to recover its deposits in excess of available insurance, if any.
A significant deterioration of the current global economic and credit market environment could challenge the
Company’s efforts to maintain a diversified asset allocation with creditworthy financial institutions.
In addition, the Company may invest some of its cash in longer-term investment opportunities, including the
acquisition of other entities or operations, the reduction of certain liabilities such as unfunded pension liabilities
and/or repurchases of the Company’s outstanding shares. To the extent the Company uses cash for such other
purposes, the amount of cash available for the working capital needs described above would be reduced.
Collection from customers
The Company is subject to the risk of loss due to clients’ inability to fulfill their obligations with respect to trade
receivables, contract assets, and other financial assets. A client’s inability to fulfill its obligations could have an
adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and profitability.
In addition, the Company typically bills clients for engineering services in arrears and is, therefore, subject to its
clients delaying or failing to pay invoices after the Company has already committed resources to their projects. If
one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay a significant amount of the Company’s outstanding
receivables, this could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s liquidity, financial condition and results
of operations.

172

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Impairment of goodwill and other non-current intangible and tangible assets
In accordance with IFRS, goodwill is assessed for impairment no less frequently than on an annual basis by
determining whether the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit (“CGU”) or group of CGUs exceeds its
carrying amount. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGU
or group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated, requiring management’s estimates and judgements that
are inherently subjective and uncertain, and thus may change over time. The key assumptions required for the
value in use estimation are the future cash flows growth rate and the discount rate. The determination of these
estimated cash flows requires the exercise of judgement, which might result in significant variances in the carrying
amount of these assets.
The Company cannot guarantee that new events or unfavourable circumstances will not take place that would
lead it to reassess the value of goodwill and record a significant goodwill impairment loss, which could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position.
Non-current tangible and intangible assets, including the Company’s investments accounted for by the equity
method, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. A non-current tangible or
intangible asset is considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more
events that occurred after the initial recognition of that given asset, the estimated future cash flows of such asset
has been negatively affected. In such instances, the Company may be required to reduce the carrying value of the
asset to its recoverable amount. The inherent subjectivity of the Company’s estimates of future cash flows could
have a significant impact on its analysis. Any future write-offs or write-downs of assets could also have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
RISKS RELATED TO DISPUTES, INVESTIGATIONS, SETTLEMENTS AND REGULATORY MATTERS
The impact on the Company of legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and dispute settlements
The Company is or can be party to disputes in the normal course of business. Since the Company engages in
engineering and construction, and O&M activities for facilities and projects where design, construction or systems
failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, the Company is exposed to substantial
claims and litigation if there is a failure at any such project. Such claims could relate to, among other things,
personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and may
be brought forth by clients, governmental authorities or third parties, such as those who use or reside near clients’
projects. The Company can also be exposed to claims if it is agreed that a project will achieve certain
performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements, and those standards or requirements are not
met. In many contracts with clients, subcontractors, and suppliers, the Company agrees to retain or assume
potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in
claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. In addition, while clients and
subcontractors may agree to indemnify the Company against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be
unable to pay.
In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class
action litigation has often been brought forth against that company. The Company has previously been, and is
currently in one, a defendant in shareholder-instituted class action proceedings, based on alleged disclosure
failures under applicable securities legislation. The Company cannot provide any assurance that similar litigation
will not occur in the future. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s
attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating
results, and financial condition.
Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, it is not possible to (a) predict the final outcome of these and other
related proceedings generally, (b) determine if the amount included in the Company’s provisions is sufficient or
(c) determine the amount of potential losses, if any, that may be incurred in connection with any final judgment on
these matters.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

173

The Company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations. The Company’s
insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums, and insurance companies may deny claims the
Company might make. In addition, the Company has elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through
the use of various deductibles, limits and retentions under these programs. As a result, the Company may be
subject to future liability in respect of lawsuits or investigations for which it is only partially insured, or completely
uninsured.
In addition, the nature of the Company’s business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors and suppliers
presenting claims for, among other things, the recovery of costs related to certain projects. Similarly, the Company
occasionally presents change orders and other claims to its clients, subcontractors, and suppliers. If the Company
fails to properly issue the change orders or other claims, or fails to document the nature of claims and change
orders or is otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with clients, subcontractors and
suppliers, the Company could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. A failure
to recover promptly on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s liquidity and
financial results. Additionally, irrespective of how well the Company documents the nature of its claims and
change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant.
In addition, a number of project contracts have warranty periods and/or outstanding claims that may result in legal
proceedings that extend beyond the actual performance and completion of the projects.
Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently subject to uncertainties and unfavourable rulings can and do
occur. Pending or future claims against the Company could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal
liability, warranty obligations, and other liabilities which, to the extent the Company is not insured against a loss or
its insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
The Company is subject to ongoing investigations that could subject the Company to criminal and administrative
enforcement actions, civil actions and sanctions, fines and other penalties, some of which may be significant.
These investigations, and potential results thereof, could harm the Company’s reputation, result in suspension,
prohibition or debarment of the Company from participating in certain projects, reduce its revenues and net
income and adversely affect its business.
The Company understands that there are investigations by various authorities which may remain ongoing in
connection with certain legacy matters in various jurisdictions, including, without limitation, Algeria, Brazil and
Angola.
On September 23, 2021, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the “RCMP”) represented by the Province of
Québec’s Directeur des Poursuites Criminelles et Pénales (“DPCP”) laid charges against the Company’s
subsidiary, SNC-Lavalin Inc. and its indirect subsidiary, SNC-Lavalin International Inc. Each entity was jointly
charged (along with a former employee of the Company, Normand Morin) with the following counts: 1) forgery
under Section 366 of the Criminal Code (Canada) (the “Criminal Code”), 2) fraud under Section 380 of the
Criminal Code, and 3) fraud against the government under Section 121 of the Criminal Code. Each entity was
charged with one count of conspiracy to commit the aforementioned crimes (the “Criminal Charges”). On the
same date, the DPCP gave notice to SNC-Lavalin Inc. and SNC-Lavalin International Inc. of an invitation to
negotiate a remediation agreement in accordance with Part XXII.1. of the Criminal Code with respect to the
Criminal Charges and on October 1, 2021, both entities formally accepted the invitation. These Criminal Charges
follow the RCMP’s formal investigation relating to alleged payments in connection with a 2002 contract for the
refurbishment of the Jacques Cartier Bridge by a consortium which included SNC-Lavalin Inc. and which
previously led to a guilty plea on certain criminal charges in 2017 by the former head of the Canada Federal
Bridges Corporation. Another former employee of the Company, Kamal Francis, was also charged separately with
similar offenses.
SNC-Lavalin Inc. and SNC-Lavalin International Inc. reached agreement on the terms of the remediation
agreement and, on May 11, 2022, the Québec Superior Court issued an order approving the remediation
agreement (the “Remediation Agreement”). The Remediation Agreement has a three-year term, and requires a
total payment of $29.6 million payable over three years as well as the appointment of a monitor for a three-year
period, amongst other obligations. The Criminal Charges are suspended during the term of the Remediation

174

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Agreement, and, upon its expiry, provided the terms will have been complied with and subject to Court approval,
the Criminal Charges will be dismissed. Also on May 11, 2022, the Company entered into an administrative
agreement with Public Services and Procurement Canada allowing the Company to continue to do business with
the Canadian federal government and federal departments and agencies under the auspices of the federal
Integrity Regime despite the Criminal Charges being suspended pursuant to the Remediation Agreement.
Failure by the Company to abide by the terms of the Remediation Agreement could result in serious
consequences for the Company, including new sanctions, legal actions and/or suspension from eligibility to carry
on business with the government or agency involved or to work on projects funded by them. The Company is
taking steps that are expected to mitigate these risks.
Except for the Jacques Cartier Bridge investigation, the Company is currently unable to determine when any of
these investigations will be completed, or whether other investigations of the Company by these or other
authorities will be initiated or the scope of current investigations broadened. The Company continues to cooperate
and communicate with authorities in connection with all ongoing investigations.
If regulatory, enforcement or administrative authorities or third parties determine to take action against the
Company, or to sanction the Company in connection with possible violations of law, contracts or otherwise as a
result of ongoing or future investigations, the consequences of any such sanctions or other actions, whether
actual or alleged, could require the Company to pay material fines or damages, consent to restrictions on future
conduct or lead to other penalties, including temporary or permanent, mandatory or discretionary suspension,
prohibition or debarment from participating in projects, or the revocation of authorizations or certifications, by
certain administrative organizations or by governments (such as the Government of Canada and/or the
Government of Québec) under applicable procurement laws, regulations, policies or practices. The Company
derives a significant percentage of its annual consolidated revenue from government and government-related
contracts. Further, public and private sector bid processes in some instances assess whether the bidder, or an
affiliate thereof, has ever been the object of any investigations, or sanctions or other actions resulting therefrom.
In such instances, if the Company or one of its subsidiaries or investee entities must answer affirmatively to a
query as to past or current investigations, or sanctions or other actions resulting therefrom, such answer may
affect that entity’s ability to be considered for the applicable project. In addition, the Company may not win
contracts that it has bid upon due to a client’s perception of the Company’s reputation and/or perceived
reputational advantages held by competitors as a result of such investigations, sanctions or other actions. Loss of
bidding opportunities resulting from such investigations, sanctions or other actions, whether discretionary
(including as a result of reputational factors) or mandatory, from participating in certain government, governmentrelated and private contracts (in Canada, Canadian provinces or elsewhere) could materially adversely affect the
Company’s business, financial condition and liquidity and the market price of the Company’s issued and traded
securities.
The outcomes of ongoing or future investigations could also result in, among other things, (i) covenant defaults
under various project contracts, (ii) third party claims, which may include claims for special, indirect, derivative or
consequential damages, or (iii) adverse consequences on the Company’s ability to secure or continue its own
financing, or to continue or secure financing for current or future projects, any of which could materially adversely
affect the Company’s business, financial condition and liquidity and the market price of the Company’s issued and
traded securities. In addition, these investigations and outcomes of these investigations and any negative publicity
associated therewith, could damage the Company’s reputation and ability to do business.
Due to the uncertainties related to the outcome of ongoing or future investigations, the Company is currently
unable to reliably estimate an amount of potential liabilities or a range of potential liabilities, if any, in connection
with any of these investigations.
The Company’s senior management and Board of Directors have been required to devote significant time and
resources to the investigations described above and ongoing related matters, as well as the investigations leading
to the settlements described below, which have distracted and may continue to distract senior management and
the Board of Directors from the conduct of the Company’s daily business, and significant expenses have been
and may continue to be incurred in connection with such investigations including substantial fees of lawyers and
other advisors. In addition, the Company and/or its employees or former employees could become the subject of
these or other investigations by law enforcement and/or regulatory authorities in respect of the matters described

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

175

above or below, or other matters, which, in turn, could require the devotion of additional time of senior
management and the diversion or utilization of other resources.
In addition, the Company has entered in a number of settlement agreements, including in December 2019 with
the Public Prosecution Service of Canada (the “PPSC”) in connection with charges against the Company and its
indirect subsidiaries SNC-Lavalin International Inc. and SNC-Lavalin Construction Inc. under Section 380 of the
Criminal Code and Section 3(1)(b) of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada) (the “Charges”). As
part of the PPSC settlement, SNC-Lavalin Construction Inc. accepted a plea of guilty to a single charge of fraud
(the “Plea”), the Charges were withdrawn and SNC-Lavalin Construction Inc. agreed to pay a fine in the amount of
$280 million, payable in equal installments over 5 years, and to be subject to a three-year probation order. The
Company estimated the net present value of these installments at $257.3 million at the date of settlement. The
Company has complied with the probation order. The Plea may result in, among other things, (i) breaches and/or
events of default under various project agreements giving rise to discretionary termination rights in favour of the
counterparties thereto, (ii) third party claims, which may include claims for special, indirect, derivative or
consequential damages, or (iii) adverse consequences on the Company’s ability to secure financing, or to
continue to secure financing for current or future projects, any of which could materially adversely affect the
Company’s business, financial condition and liquidity and the market prices of the Company’s publicly traded
securities.
In addition, potential consequences of the Plea could include, in respect of the Company or one or more of its
subsidiaries, suspension, prohibition or debarment from participating in public or private sector projects or bids, or
the revocation of authorizations or certifications, by certain governments or by certain administrative
organizations. While the Company does not anticipate that the Plea will affect the eligibility of the Company to bid
on future projects that are aligned with its strategic direction, possible suspension, prohibition, debarment or loss
of bidding opportunities or the revocation of authorizations or certifications, as a result of the Plea, could have a
short term material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and liquidity and the market
prices of the Company’s publicly traded securities.
The Company cannot predict if any other actions may be taken by any other applicable government or authority or
the Company’s customers or other third parties as a result of the Plea.
A description of the most material legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and settlements involving the
Company is set forth in Note 32 to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements.
Employee, agent or partner misconduct or failure to comply with anti-corruption and other government
laws and regulations
The Company is subject to various rules, regulations, laws, and other legal requirements, enforced by
governments or other authorities. Further regulatory developments, namely abrupt changes in foreign government
policies and regulations, could have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s results.
In addition, misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities
by one of the Company’s employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on the
Company’s business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government
procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting
bribery and other foreign corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labour and other costs in
government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal control
over financial reporting, environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations. For example, the
CFPOA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries
from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition,
the Company provides services that may be highly sensitive or that could relate to critical national security
matters. If a security breach were to occur, the Company’s ability to procure future government contracts could be
severely limited.
The Company’s policies mandate compliance with these regulations and laws, and the Company takes
precautions intended to prevent and detect misconduct. However, since internal controls are subject to inherent
limitations, including human error, it is possible that these controls could be intentionally circumvented, or become

176

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

inadequate because of changed conditions. As a result, the Company cannot assure that its controls will protect
the Company from reckless or criminal acts committed by employees, agents or partners. Failure to comply with
applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject the Company to fines and penalties, loss of
security clearances, and suspension, prohibition or debarment from contracting, any or all of which could harm the
Company’s reputation, subject the Company to criminal and administrative enforcement actions and civil actions
and have a negative impact on the Company’s business.
Reputation of the Company
The consequence of reputational risk is a negative impact on the Company’s public image, which may influence
the Company’s ability to obtain future projects, negatively affect trust relationships with clients and profitability on
ongoing projects or cause the cancellation of current projects. Reputational risk may arise under many situations
including, among others, quality or performance issues on the Company’s projects, a poor health and safety
record or environmental, social and governance issues, alleged or proven non-compliance with laws or
regulations by the Company’s employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers and/or partners, and creation of
pollution and contamination.
RISKS RELATING TO COMPLIANCE AND FINANCIAL REPORTING
Inherent limitations to the Company’s control framework
The Company maintains accounting systems and internal controls over its financial reporting and disclosure
controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations to any control framework, as controls can be circumvented
by individuals (intentionally or otherwise), collusion of two or more individuals, management override of controls,
lapses in judgement, and breakdowns resulting from human error. There are no systems or controls that can
provide absolute assurance that all fraud, error, circumvention of controls or omission of disclosures can and will
be prevented or detected. Such fraud, error, circumvention of controls or omission of disclosures could result in a
material misstatement of financial information. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Environmental laws and regulations
The Company is exposed to various environmental risks, and is required to comply with environmental laws and
regulations, which vary from country to country, and are all subject to change. Any non-compliance by the
Company with environmental laws and regulations could result in penalties, lawsuits, and potential harm to its
reputation.
The Company manages several legacy sites for which the Company has potential exposure to the costs of
environmental remediation and possible harm to neighboring properties and communities. While the Company is
taking steps to manage this risk and has taken provisions in its financial statements for the related risk and
expense, there can be no assurance that it will not be subject to claims for damages, remediation and other
related matters, and its provisions may not fully cover any such future claim or expense.
Growing concerns about climate change may also result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations.
Legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could result in increased
compliance costs for the Company and its clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production
or refining of fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases
through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. Such policy changes could
increase the costs of projects for clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby
potentially reducing the need for the Company’s services, which would, in turn, have a material adverse impact on
the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. However, these changes could also
increase the pace of projects, such as carbon capture or storage projects and decarbonation projects, that could
have a positive impact on the Company’s business. The Company cannot predict when or whether any of these
various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on the Company or on its customers.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

177

GLOBAL / MACROECONOMIC RISKS
Global economic conditions
Unfavorable global economic conditions may have an impact on clients’ willingness and ability to fund their
projects. These conditions could make it difficult for the Company’s clients to accurately forecast and plan future
business trends and activities, thereby causing clients to slow or even curb spending on the Company’s services,
or seek contract terms more favourable to them. Global economic conditions could also be adversely impacted by
more restrictions on certain economic relations between countries or group of countries, or by an increased level
of trade protectionism. The Company’s government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from
funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate contracts with little or
no prior notice. Furthermore, any financial difficulties suffered by the Company’s partners, subcontractors or
suppliers could increase costs or adversely impact project schedules. Unfavourable economic conditions can also
reduce the availability of liquidity and credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of industrial
business operations worldwide. Volatile financial market conditions and adverse credit market conditions could
adversely affect clients’, partners’ or the Company’s own borrowing capacity, which support the continuation and
expansion of projects worldwide. This could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project delays,
payment delays or defaults by the Company’s clients. The Company’s ability to operate or expand its business
would be limited if, in the future, the Company is unable to access sufficient credit capacity, including capital
market funding, bank credit, such as letters of credit, and surety bonding on favourable terms or at all. These
disruptions could materially impact the Company’s backlog, revenues and net income.
Inflation
Inflationary pressures could have an impact on the cost of labour, supplies, and materials, as well as on various
selling, general and administrative expenses, which may vary from different geographic areas.
While certain contracts include price-indexation clauses aimed at protecting the Company from the increase of
certain costs, the Company generally bears the risk of rising inflation in connection with fixed-rate and other fixedprice contracts. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the price-indexation clauses included in the
Company’s contracts with its customers will result in recovering all cost increases on a given contract, including
but not limited to cost increases resulting from price-indexation clauses in contracts with subcontractors or
suppliers, if any.
The inability of the Company to recover, in whole or in part, the increase in costs from inflationary pressures may
have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Fluctuations in commodity prices
Commodity prices can affect the Company’s clients in a number of ways. For example, for those clients that
produce commodity products, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow, and,
therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. To the extent commodity prices
decline and the Company’s clients defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for the
Company’s services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial
condition, and results of operations.
Commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. Rising commodity prices and price volatility can
adversely affect the Company’s ability to reasonably forecast or estimate future costs and negatively impact the
cost of completing future projects as well as those in progress, and could have a material adverse impact on the
Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Income taxes
The Company is subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions throughout the world. The tax legislation,
regulations and interpretations that apply to its operations are continually changing. Moreover, future tax benefits
and liabilities are dependent on factors that are inherently uncertain and subject to change, including future
earnings, future tax rates, and anticipated business mix in the various jurisdictions in which the Company
operates and holds assets. Careful judgement is necessary in determining the required provision for income
taxes, and management uses accounting and fiscal principles to determine income tax positions that it believes
are likely to be sustained. However, there is no assurance that the Company's tax benefits or tax liabilities will not
materially differ from its estimates or expectations. In the ordinary course of business, there are many
transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although management believes
that its tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could nonetheless be materially affected by many
factors, including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting
standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, the Company’s global mix of earnings and the
realizability of deferred income tax assets. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's net income or cash flows by affecting its operations and profitability, the availability of tax credits, the
cost of the services it provides, and the availability of deductions for operating losses as the Company grows its
business. An increase or decrease in the Company’s effective income tax rate could have a material adverse
impact on its financial condition and results of operations.

Controls and Procedures
15.1

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

The CEO and the CFO have designed disclosure controls and procedures, or caused them to be designed under
their supervision, to provide reasonable assurance that:
i.

Material information relating to the Company is made known to them by others, particularly during
the period in which the annual filings are being prepared; and

ii.

Information required to be disclosed by the Company in its annual filings, interim filings or other
reports filed or submitted by it under securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in securities legislation.

Based on their evaluation carried out to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were designed
and operated effectively as at December 31, 2023.
The CEO and the CFO have also evaluated, or caused to be evaluated under their supervision, the effectiveness
of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, and its internal control over financial reporting, in each
case as at December 31, 2023.
Based on their evaluation carried out to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was designed
and operated effectively as at December 31, 2023, using the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013
Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

15.2

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
most recent interim period and year ended December 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
